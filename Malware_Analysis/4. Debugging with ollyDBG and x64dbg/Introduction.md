## Overview

Debugging is researching the assembly code by running the program to determine how the program works.

## Debugging Process

There are 2 ways to debug a program:

**Start new program:** Start the program with the debugger, the program is loaded to the memory and stops running prior to the execution of its entry point. Have complete control of the program.

**Attach running program:** Attach the debugger to a program that is already running. All the program's threads are paused, and now it is possible to debug it. This is a good approach to debug a program after it has been running.

## Debugging Terminology

**Breakpoint:** Breakpoints are used to pause the execution, and allows to examine the programs state. This is needed since it is not possible to access registers or memory address while the program is executing, those constantly change.

**Int 3/0xCC:** This is the operation code for breakpoint. When the CPU get to the 0xCC it know to stop for the debugger.

**Patching:** This is the ability to write and change existing operations and instructions of the program in order to change its functionality.

## Breakpoints

**Software breakpoints:** Breakpoint that added to the program by adding the INT 3 instruction to a specific place.

**Conditional breakpoints:** Software breakpoint that will break only if a certain condition is true.

**Hardware breakpoints:** Breakpoint that use a dedicated CPU registers. This is set on a specific memory address and stop the program without adding instructions.

**Memory breakpoints:** Set on a block of code in the memory, in order to break when this block of code is accessed.
