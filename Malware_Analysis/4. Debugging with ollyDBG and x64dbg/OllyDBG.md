OllyDBG provides the ability to analyze malware while it is running. This tool is commonly used by malware analysts and reverse engineers because it's free, easy to use, and it has many plug-ins that extend its capabilities.

## OllyDBG Views

### Code View

The upper left window is the code window. in here the program flow is presented as assembly instructions.

This windows is divided to several parts. Memory address, opcode, assembly, comments.

### Register View

The upper right window is the register window. In here the register and flags are represented.

This window is divided to several parts. Register value, flags, error checks.

The ST.. on the bottom is segment registers. They are used for dividing the program segments. ELF is the sum of the flags. All the registers and flags that change in the last instruction are red, those that are in gray stay the same.

LastErr indicate the errors in the program and specify that error address.

### Memory Dump View\

The lower left window is the dump window. Here is the code address and his hex and ascii dump.

This window is divided to several parts. Code address, hex dump, and ascii dump.

### Stack View

The lower right window is the stack window. In here the stack and his values are represent.

This window is divided into several parts. Memory address, ascii and stack values.

## Executing Code

**<<**: Restart the loaded executable

**>**: Run the loaded executable

**->**: Run the thread debugging for multi-threaded applications, by pressing T in the Threads window

**| |**: Pause the running program

**->:**: Run one instruction at a time, get into any call and function in the program flow

**|>:**: Run one instruction at a time, don't get into any call and function, stay in the main function

## Extra Features

### Memory Map

The memory map window denoted by M displays all memory blocks allocated to the program. It displays how the program is laid out in memory.

Executable code, DLLs and more are displayed in this window. Double clicking on a block shows its memory dump. By right clicking it's possible to send anything to the disassembler window.

### Threads

The threads window denoted by T display all memory locations of the threads and their current status.

In order to debug different threads all threads must be paused. In order to debug single thread pause the program, set breakpoint, and continue on with particular thread.
