## Dependency Walker

Dependency Walker allows to monitor all of the directories that the program imports at run time. It can help monitor imported DLLs and list functions that are called from specific DLLs.

By default dependency walker outputs all functions that are present in an imported DLL file. We can use the profiling feature to only see live-called functions from the DLL.
**Profile** tab -> **Start Profiling**.

## Sysmon

System Monitor (Sysmon) is part of the Sysinternals suite. It monitors and logs system activity. It provides detailed information about process creation, network connections, and changes in file creation times within the event log. Collecting events generated by Sysmon can assist in detecting malicious activity and prompt further investigation. Sysmon is typically used with SIEM or WEC systems.

## Regshot

Regshot allows you to take snapshots of the registry and compare the differences.

## Process Monitor

The information showed about each event is either very detailed and can't be shown entirely on the screen, or is very hard to read.

Process monitor allows users to view the full details of a given event by double-clicking its respective row. It offers advanced filtering to filter the details of a specific process or action.

## FakeNet-NG

FakeNet-NG allows to intercept and redirect all network traffic while simulating legitimate network services. It can be installed on both Linux and Windows OS.

## INetSim

INetSim is a pre-installed Linux utility, used to simulate common internet services in a closed lab environment to imitate normal network activity. This is similar to FakeNet-NG.
