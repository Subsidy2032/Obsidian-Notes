Dynamic analysis (or behavior analysis) involves executing a malware in a monitored environment to examine its behavior and impact on the system.

Dynamic analysis can also be used to bypass encoding techniques, packers, etc.

## Investigation Vectors

**File System Changes:** Understanding which files were modified, deleted, or created can compromise the malware activity.

**Network Activity:** Analyzing the system's network activity after executing malware can provide additional insights about the malware behavior.

**Registry Changes:** Analyzing the file's access to registry or examining changes made to the registry can explicate the malicious behavior of the file.

**Dynamic Link Library:** This is a Windows file containing code and data that can be used by another file. It's primarily used to allow program to use the same code without having to embed the code in the system itself.
