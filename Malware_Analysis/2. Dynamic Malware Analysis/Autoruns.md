With Autoruns we can identify programs which start at startup.

We can google a file path that appears malicious, or we can right click on the file entry and then Check VirusTotal.

Things to check for if unsure:

- Use google to search the file name and location, check if it's a recognized software and if it's running from the expected location.
- Check the description for signs such as incorrect grammar or seemingly randomly generate descriptions.
- Look for temporary directories, why should a program that start at boot be at a temporary directory?
- Hash the file and check VirusTotal.
- You can right click on an entry, then Jump to Image in order to see functions of the file.
- Look for the file in process explorer
