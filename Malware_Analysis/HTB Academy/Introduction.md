## Malware Objective Categories

- Disrupting host system operations
- Stealing critical information, including personal and financial data
- Gaining unauthorized access to systems
- Conducting espionage activities
- Sending spam messages
- Utilizing the victim's system for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
- Implementing ransomware to lock up victim's files on their host and demanding ransom

## Malware Types

- **Viruses:** Designed to infiltrate and multiply within host files, transitioning from one system to another. They latch into legitimate programs, and take effect when the infected files are triggered. It can even spread through network.
- **Worms:** Worms can multiply across network devices without human interaction, they exploit network weaknesses to infiltrate systems without permission. They can deliver damaging payloads, or keep multiplying to other vulnerable devices.
- **Trojans:** Disguised as regular software to trick users into running them. Upon entering the system, they craft backdoors, allowing attackers to control the system. They can be weaponized to pilfer sensitive data, such as passwords or financial information, and orchestrate other harmful activities on the infected host.
- **Ransomware:** It encrypts files on the target system, making them unreachable. Attackers then demand a ransom in exchange for the decryption key.
- **Spyware:** This malware stealthily gathers sensitive data or user activities without their consent. It can track online browsing habits, record keystrokes, and capture login credentials.
- **Adware:** It shows uninvited and invasive advertisements on infected systems. They may also collect user data for targeted advertising.
- **Botnets:** Stealthy form of malware, designed to take control over the fundamental components (the "root") of an operating system. They alter system functions to conceal their presence, making them extremely challenging to spot and eliminate. They can be used to prolong access and evade security protocols.
- **Backdoors/RATs (Remote Access Trojans):** Those are crafted to provide unauthorized access and control over compromised systems from remote locations.
- **Droppers:** Used to transport and install extra malicious software into infected system. They serve as a conduit for other malware, ensuring the covert installation and execution of more sophisticated threats.
- **Information Stealers:** Tailored to target and extract sensitive data. Like login credentials, personal information, or intellectual property. This includes identity theft or selling the data on the dark web.

Those examples are just some of the types of malware.

## Malware Analysis Definition, Purpose, and Common Activities

Malware analysis is done to comprehend the inner workings of malware. It aids in understanding the threat posed by malicious software and devising effective countermeasures.

We will delve into the malware code, structure, and functionality to gain profound insights into its purpose, propagation methods, and potential impact on targeted systems. By answering pertinent questions, such as the type of malware, its intended behavior on endpoints, the aftermath of its execution, the extent of damage it can inflict, its attribution to specific thread groups, and creating detection rules based on the analysis to detect the malware across the entire network, we can devise robust defense mechanisms against these threads.

Malware analysis serves several pivotal purposes, such as:

- **Detection and Classification:** Through analyzing malware, we can identify and categorize different types of threats based on their unique characteristics, signatures, or patterns. This enables us to develop detection rules and empowers security professionals to gain a comprehensive understanding of the nature of the malware they encounter.
- **Reverse Engineering:** Malware analysis often involves the intricate process of reverse engineering the malware's code to discern its underlying operations and employed techniques. This can unveil concealed functionalities, encryption methods, details about the command-and-control infrastructure, and techniques used for obfuscation and evasion.
- **Behavioral Analysis:** By meticulously studying the behavior of malware during execution, we gain insights into its actions, such as modifications to the file system, network communications, changes to the system registry, and attempts to exploit vulnerabilities. This analysis provides invaluable information about the impact of the malware on infected systems and assists in devising potential countermeasures.
- **Threat Intelligence:** Through malware analysis, threat researchers can amass critical intelligence about attackers, their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and the malware's origins. This valuable intelligence can be shared with the wider security community to enhance detection, prevention, and response capabilities.

The `techniques` employed in malware analysis encompass a wide array of methods and tools, including:

- **Static Analysis:** This approach involves scrutinizing the malware's code without executing it, examining the file structure, identifying strings, searching for known signatures, and studying metadata to gain preliminary insights into the malware's characteristics.
- **Dynamic Analysis:** Dynamic analysis entails executing the malware within a controlled environment, such as a sandbox or virtual machine, to observe its behavior and capture its runtime activities. This includes monitoring network traffic, system calls, file system modifications, and other interactions.
- **Code Analysis:** Code analysis (includes reverse engineering) and involves disassembling or decompiling the malware's code to understand its logic, functions, algorithms, and employed techniques. This helps in identifying concealed functionalities, exploitation methods, encryption methods, details about the command-and-control infrastructure, and techniques used for obfuscation and evasion. Ιnferentially, code analysis can also help in uncovering potential Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
- **Memory Analysis:** Analyzing the malware's interactions with system memory helps in identifying injected code, hooks, or other runtime manipulations. This can be instrumental in detecting rootkits, analyzing anti-analysis techniques, or identifying malicious payloads.
- **Malware Unpacking:** This technique refers to the process of extracting and isolating the hidden malicious code within a piece of malware that uses packing techniques to evade detection. Packers are used by malware authors to compress, encrypt, or obfuscate their malicious code, making it harder for antivirus software and other security tools to identify the threat. Unpacking involves reverse-engineering these packing techniques to reveal the original, unobfuscated code for further analysis. This can allow researchers to understand the malware's functionality, behavior, and potential impact.
