Static analysis is analyzing the program for potential malicious behavior without running it.

## Magic Bytes

Magic byte is a term that describes the signature of the file. There are header (initial bytes) and footer (last bytes).

In Linux to execute a file its magic bytes will be read, while on Windows an extension is required.

### Hex Editor

Hex editor is a program that allows the user to edit the raw content of  a file. There are typically 3 areas:

- Left side: byte address
- Center: Hex code
- Right side: characters

[HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20) is a free multi platform tool for editing and viewing the hex code of a file.

### Binwalk Tool

Binwalk allows the identification of all magic byte patterns in a file. Sometimes a file may contain other files with the intent of hiding them.

## Sysinternals Suite

Sysinternals is a collection of tools that is used to manage, diagnose, troubleshoot and monitor Windows environment. There is a live version that doesn't require installation.

### Strings

The Strings tool prints hardcoded ASCII content in the executable. It can for example print hardcoded functions or credentials.

### SigCheck

SigCheck is used to perform a security related functions on one or more files. It allows the verification of file digital signature, hash listing and version information.

### Certutil

Certutil enables the generation of multiple hash signatures.

## Identifying Malwares

File hash: we can search the hash of a file in google, and find if it's malicious.

We can also use Virustotal for the same purpose.

## Portable Executable

PE is a file format for executables used in Windows OS. It encapsulates the information necessary for the Windows OS loader to manage executable code and run it. .exe is the most common extension of PE.

### PE File Structure

.text: This section contains the compiled code that is run directly by the OS. Can show the commands that are intended to run on the CPU. It also contains the DLLs the program uses, their functions, and their code.

.rdata: This section contains read-only information, for example a list of imported and exported files in the case of DLL files. There are tools to examine this section.

.data: This section contains global information that is available to the program itself. For example, variables.

.rsrc: This section contain all resources that can not be defined by code. For example photos, videos, icons, logs.

### PEview

PEview is a tool that enables viewing PE structure content. It displays headers, sections, directories, import/export tables, and resources within an EXE file.

PE section roles can be found via google.

### PEiD

PEiD is a portable executable detection tool that recognizes the most common packers, cryptors, and compilers for PE files.

By analyzing PE file formats a lot of information can be gathered. PEiD enables detection and analysis of the ".text" section and its content.

### Resource Hacker

Enables the viewing and editing of all resources in executables and compiled resource library. It analyzes the ".rsrc section.

It's primarily a GUI application, but it also enables compiling and decompiling resources from the command-line.
