## Introduction

The Interactive Disassembler Professional (IDA Pro) is an extremely powerful disassembler distributed by Hex-Rays. It meant to be interactive, and all aspects of its disassembly process can be modified, manipulated rearranged, or redefined.

IDA Pro can save your analysis progress, add comments, label data, and name functions. IDA pro also have a huge support for plugins.

### Loading a File

When opening a new file IDA generates a list of potential file types, those are the loaders that are best suited to deal with the selected file. Binary File is the default for file that IDA doesn't recognize, it will always show up on the list.

The processor type refers to the type of processor that the program work with.

## IDA Code Flow

### Interface

After loading a program, IDA will open the disassembly window. This is the primary place for manipulating and analyzing binaries. This is the graph view, it looks like program flowcharts. You can visualize the function's control flow from one block to another.

The text mode of the disassembly window is a more traditional view, and the main use of it is to view data regions of a binary. The left display is known as the arrow window and shows the program nonlinear flow. In the text mode the entire disassembly code is showed at once, as opposed to one function at a time in graph mode.

### Arrows

In text mode, solid lines mark unconditional jumps, while dashed lines mark conditional jumps. Arrows facing up indicate a loop.

In graph mode the arrow color is red if the conditional jump is not taken, green if its taken, and blue if its unconditional jump. The arrow direction shows the program's flow, upward arrows typically denote a loop situation.

## Windows for Analysis

**Function Window:** Lists all functions in the executable and shows the length of each. It also associates flags with each function: L - library functions, F - far functions, S - static functions.

**Names Window:** Lists every address with a name, including functions, named code, named data, and strings.

**Strings Window:** Shows all strings, by default this list shows only ASCII strings longer then five characters. You can right-click in the Strings window and select Setup to change it.

**Imports/exports Window:** Lists all imports for a file. And lists all exported functions for a file. This window is useful when you are analyzing DLLs.

**Structures Window:** Lists the layout of all active data structures. This window also provides you the ability to make your own data structures for use as memory layout templates.

## Navigation

Jump to location or function: To jump to any virtual memory address, simply press the G key while in the disassembly window, then enter a virtual memory address or named location, such as sub_401730 or printf.

Jump to file offset: Jump to a raw file offset. For example, if by viewing a PE file in a hex editor and found something interesting, such as a string or shell code, this feature helps to get to that raw offset, because when the file is loaded it will be mapped as though it had been loaded by the OS loader.

## Searching

We can search by code text and specific byte. Next code is to move the cursor to the next location containing instruction you specify. Text search is searching the entire disassembly window for a string.

## Navigation Band

The navigation band presents a color-coded linear view of the loaded binary's address space. Pink is for imports, gray for defined data, and brown for undefined data.

## Links and Cross-References

Cross references can help determine where certain functions were called from. Cross references show how a particular piece of information was accessed.

## Documentation Options

### Naming

IDA is automatically naming virtual address and stack variables, but it also has the ability to rename if needed. It's possible to rename any function and variables in the code by pressing ctrl+n, press ; to add comment.

IDA will change the name in every place that have the function automatically.

### Decompiler

High level language representation is much easier to read then the low level assembly language. IDA pro has a special decompiler that can analyze the assembly code and show it in C.

### Variables Identification

IDA identify variables automatically.

## Patching with IDA

IDA can modify the executable file and generate a new file, IDA can patch by word or by byte. When there is a need to bypass a certain part in the program patching is the way to go.

### Patching Steps

1. **Identification:** Identify the part in the program that control the function that we want to change.
2. **Instruction:** Search the important assembly instruction that control the flow code. For example, JMP or JZ.
3. **Change:** Change the instruction we found to the instruction that do what you want. For example change JZ to JNZ.
4. **Assemble:** Assemble the code and create a new executable.
5. **Run:** Run the new patched program and verify that its working.

### Plugins

A plugin module is a model written on C++ that provides additional functionality to IDA. Usually, a plugin is invoked through a hotkey or the menu system. The registered and loaded plugins will appear in a special Edit Plugins submenu. A plugin may provide better analysis, automation of tedious tasks.

Labeless plugin: Plugin for both IDA pro and popular debuggers. Labeless is a multipurpose IDA pro plugin system for labels/comments synchronization with a debugger backend, with complex memory dumping and interactive Python scripting capabilities.
