## IDT

The Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) is a data structure used by x86 architecture CPUs. It is used by the CPU in order to determine the correct response for specific interrupts and exceptions.

There are 3 types of interrupts: software, hardware interrupts, and processor exceptions.

### SIDT Instruction

Store Interrupt Descriptor Table (SIDT) is a CPU instruction that can be used by a process with low privileges to store the contents, meaning the memory address of the Interrupt Descriptor Table Register (IDTR) in a destination operand.

## Red Pill

Red pill is a VM-detection technique, that resides in the fact that virtual environment creates another IDTR, in a memory location that can be identified for any VM solution.

Since the SIDT x86 CPU instruction does not require elevated privileges, the location of the IDTR table can be checked by any process. In a non-virtualized environment the IDTR memory address starts with 0x80xxxxxx.

## Blue Pill

Blue pill is a form of malware that executes as a hypervisor to gain control of the computer resources. The hypervisor installation does not require any restart, and the computer functions normally.
