## VM Detection Overview

VM detection is a term used to describe indicators of virtual environment, those indicators are used by the program to identify their execution environment. VM detection techniques are used by malware developers in order to evade detection. A malware can behave differently in a virtual environment or not execute at all.

### Registry Values

Each of the VM's contain different registry values:

**Virtualbox:** `HARDWARE\\DESCRIPTION\\System
`
**VMWare:** `SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\Disk\\Enum`

## Anti Anti Debugging

In order to bypass most of the defenses, we can get inside the functions responsible and change the run values or jumps that the code performs.

## Anti-VM Detection

Malware analysts can bypass the VM-Detection logic of a malware by modifying the environment or the executable itself. Other anti-debugging techniques can be bypassed as well.
