## Definitions

- AI: Enables machines to mimic human intelligence.
- Generative AI: Type of AI that can create original content such as text, audio, images, etc. Generative AI is not always built on LLM.
- Language models: AI that understand, interpret, and generate human language.
- Large Language Models (LLMs): Advanced language models trained on vast amount of text data. They can comprehend and produce text in a way that feels incredibly human-like.

## LLMs learning process

- Trained using examples from a massive dataset of text, learning patterns, grammar, and information about the world.
- Use of algorithms and statistical methods to improve their understanding over time.

## Applications of LLMs

- Chatbots, writing assistance, content creation, and language translation.
- Useful for writing tasks automation, providing costumer support, and enhancing communication.

## The Future and Challenges of LLMs

- Future: Technology improvements, like better understanding and more personalized interactions.
- Ethical and technical challenges: Bias, privacy, need for responsible usage.

## The AI Development Cycle

- Problem Identification
- Data Collection
- Model Design
- Training
- Evaluation
- Deployment
- Monitoring and Maintenance

## Tokenization

Converting text into smaller units (tokens) that the computer can understand. Tokens can be words, characters, or subwords.

### Preprocessing

Text is cleaned and standardized (e.g. lowercasing, removing punctuation) to make tokenization more effective.

### Breaking Down Text

The AI splits the text based on predefined rules or learned patterns. This can involve splitting by spaces, punctuation, or using algorithms to identify subword units in a language.

### Converting Tokens to Numbers

Each token is assigned a unique number, which the AI processes.

### Training and Understanding

The numbers (tokens) are used by the AI to learn patterns, grammar, and meanings during training. When processing new text, it uses the learned information to understand or generate text.
