ML-BOM data attestation, data sanitization, zero trust, MLSecOps.

## Data Attestation

- Employ Machine Learning Bill of Materials (ML-BOM) to ensure data legitimacy

## Security Controls

- Enforce data sanitization to remove adversarial data
- Fine-tune LLMs to tailor responses to use cases
- Implement sandboxing to restrict unauthorized data
- Integrate auto-poisoning testing into the SSDLC
