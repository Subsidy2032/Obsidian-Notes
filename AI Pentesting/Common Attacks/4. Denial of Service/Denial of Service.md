An attacker overloads an LLM with resource-intensive tasks, degrading its quality of service or incurring high costs.

## Attack Vectors

- Resource intensive requests
- Deleting model files on the server
- Traditional DoS attacks against APIs and application/server infrastructure
- Loops via indirect prompt injections (summarize website A that says to summarize website B that says to summarize website A)
- Loops via evaluated code via indirect prompt injection

## Examples

### Example 1

An attacker continuously prompts an LLM with complex and resourceintensive queries, overloading the system and preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

### Example 2

Sending long queries, queries for recurring resource usage of high volume tasks like LangChain, AutoGPT. Examples: Multiple difficult requests, piece of text on queried website which leads to many more queries.
