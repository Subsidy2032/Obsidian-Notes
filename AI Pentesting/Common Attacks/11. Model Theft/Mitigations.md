Robust access controls, centralized inventory, zero-trust.

## Enforce Access Control

- Protect LLM repository and training environments
- Restrict LLM access to network resources, internal services, and APIs

## Centralized Inventory

- Use centralized ML models registry in prod

## Continuous Validation

- Simulate adversarial TTPs to discover extraction queries
- Regularly monitor logs to detect and respond to suspicious behavior promptly
