Unauthorized access of LLM.

## Overview

- Unauthorized access and exfiltration of LLM models
- Proprietary LLM models are compromised to create a functional equivalent

## Risks

- Economic and brand reputation loss
- Competitive disadvantage

## Scenarios

- An attacker infiltrates proprietary LLM models to launch a competing LLM service
- An attacker performs a side-channel attack to retrieve model information
- An attacker sends crafted API inputs and collects outputs to create a copycat model
- An attacker can exploit the supply-chain to leak proprietary model information
