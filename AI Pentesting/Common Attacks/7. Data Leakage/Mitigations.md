Input validation, Output redirection, Restrict external data sources.

## Enforce Validation and Redaction

- Implement robust input validation to prevent sensitive data being stored
- Redact sensitive information from LLM output

## Access Management

- Do not include production data into training process
- Accounts with least privilege should be used to train the model
- Enforce strict access controls on external data sources
