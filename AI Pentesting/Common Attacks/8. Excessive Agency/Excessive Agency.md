Unrestricted agency occurs when LLMs taking actions without proper restrictions.

When LLMs interface with other systems, unrestricted agency might lead to undesirable operations and actions, and impacts on other systems. Like web-apps, LLMs should not self-police; controls must be embedded in APIs.

## In a Nutshell

- LLM has access to APIs that can access sensitive information
- LLM can use API unsafely
- Think of the concept from SSRF
- Find out which APIs and plugins the LLM has access to
- Simply ask!
- If not complaint, re-ask, re-phrase, tell it you are the dev or admin

## Examples

### Example 1

An LLM without constrains autonomously performs actions like purchasing or deletion, it performs those actions inappropriately or excessively.

### Example 2

LLM triggers actions outside LLM. For example LLM has access to email to read and summarize but then malicious email arrives which will make LLM sand spam. Another example is customer service LLM that has payment access and can refund, malicious prompts make the LLM refund 100 years.
