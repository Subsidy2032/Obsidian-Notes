Main categories of vulnerabilities:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Vulnerability**|**Description**|
|Operating System|These types of vulnerabilities are found within Operating Systems (OSs) and often result in privilege escalation.|
|(Mis)Configuration-based|These types of vulnerability stem from an incorrectly configured application or service. For example, a website exposing customer details.|
|Weak or Default Credentials|Applications and services that have an element of authentication will come with default credentials when installed. For example, an administrator dashboard may have the username and password of "admin". These are easy to guess by an attacker.|
|Application Logic|These vulnerabilities are a result of poorly designed applications. For example, poorly implemented authentication mechanisms that may result in an attacker being able to impersonate a user.|
|Human-Factor|Human-Factor vulnerabilities are vulnerabilities that leverage human behaviour. For example, phishing emails are designed to trick humans into believing they are legitimate.|

## Scoring Vulnerabilities (CVSS & VPR)

##### Common Vulnerability Scoring System

CVSS awards points to vulnerabilities based upon its features, availability and reproducibility.

It also checks if exploits exist for the vulnerability, how easy it is to exploit, how does the vulnerability interfere with the CIA triad and much more.

Classification:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Rating**|**Score**|
|None|0|
|Low|0.1 - 3.9|
|Medium|4.0 - 6.9|
|High|7.0 - 8.9|
|Critical|9.0 - 10.0|

CVSS has some disadvantages, mainly that it heavily assesses based on existence of exploits which exist for only 20% of vulnerabilities and rarely updates scores.

##### Vulnerability Priority Rating

This framework considers risk more than CVSS which relies more on impact, it also takes the relevancy into account and is dynamic.

Scoring:

|**Rating**|**Score**|
|---|---|
|Low|0.0 - 3.9|
|Medium|4.0 - 6.9|
|High|7.0 - 8.9|
|Critical|9.0 - 10.0|

VPR considers over 150 factors when calculating risk, can help with prioritizing and patching vulnerabilities.

The disadvantages are that VPR isn't open source and does not consider the CIA triad to the extent CVSS does.

## Vulnerability Databases

##### National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

NVD lists all publically categorized vulnerabilities, classified under Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE).

The format of CVEs is `CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER`.

It lets filter based on category and month, but is not great for searching vulnerabilities of a specific application.

##### Exploit-DB

[Exploit-DB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) retains exploits for software and applications stored under the name, author and version of the software or application, it is much more useful to pen testers.
