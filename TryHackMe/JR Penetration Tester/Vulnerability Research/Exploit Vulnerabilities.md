Advantages and disadvantages of automated vulnerability scanners like [Nessus](https://www.tenable.com/products/nessus):

|**Advantage**|**Disadvantage**|
|---|---|
|Automated scans are easy to repeat, and the results can be shared within a team with ease.|People can often become reliant on these tools.|
|These scanners are quick and can test numerous applications efficiently.|They are extremely "loud" and produce a lot of traffic and logging. This is not good if you are trying to bypass firewalls and the likes.|
|Open-source solutions exist.|Open-source solutions are often basic and require expensive licenses to have useful features.|
|Automated scanners cover a wide range of different vulnerabilities that may be hard to manually search for.|They often do not find every vulnerability on an application.|

Some common vulnerabilities to look for:

|**Vulnerability**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|Security Misconfigurations|Security misconfigurations involve vulnerabilities that are due to developer oversight. For example, exposing server information in messages between the application and an attacker.|
|Broken Access Control|This vulnerability occurs when an attacker is able to access parts of an application that they are not supposed to be able to otherwise.|
|Insecure Deserialization|This is the insecure processing of data that is sent across an application. An attacker may be able to pass malicious code to the application, where it will then be executed.|
|Injection|An Injection vulnerability exists when an attacker is able to input malicious data into an application. This is due to the failure of not ensuring (known as sanitising) input is not harmful.|

## Finding Manual Exploits

##### Rapid7

With Rapid7 you can filter by type of vulnerability, it also gives you instructions of how to exploit the vulnerability using the Metasploit tool.

##### GitHub

GitHub is designed for developers to share source code, Security researches using it to share PoCs.

Since there is no verification process you can find rare or fresh exploits, but with no support, GitHub uses tagging and keyword system.

##### SearchSploit

A command line copy of ExploitDB, you can search vulnerabilities by name and/or type, for example `searchsploit wordpress`.
