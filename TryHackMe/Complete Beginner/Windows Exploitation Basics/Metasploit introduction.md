#Metasploit 

## Modules

**Auxiliary:** Supporting module, such as scanners, buzzers and crawlers

**Encoders:** To encode the payload and exploit for bypassing signature-based antivirus

**Evasion:** A direct attempt to evade antivirus

**Exploits:** Exploits

**NOPs(No OPeration):** Do nothing, often used as a buffer to achieve consistent payload sizes

**Payloads:** Codes that will run on the target system

**Post:** Useful in the final stage, post-exploitation

## Payload directories

**Adapters:** Wraps single payload for converting to another format, for example wrapping in a Powershell adapter so a single power shell command will execute the payload

**Singles:** Self-contained payloads (add user, launch notepad.exe) that do not need to download additional component to run

**Stagers:** Staged payloads will first download a stager on the target system and than download the rest of the payload, so the initial file is smaller, stagers are responsible for setting up a connection channel between Metasploit and the target system

**Stages:** Downloaded by the stager, allows to use larger size payloads

## Exploits Ranking

`search type:[module] name` - Search for exploit in a specific module

`setg` To set the same value for all modules

`exploit -z` - Run the exploit in the background

`check` - Supported by some modules, check if the target system is vulnerable without exploiting it

`background` or Â `CTRL+Z` - Background the session

`sessions` - Show all sessions

`sessions -i [number]` - Interact with a session
