#Networking 
<u>Layer 7 - Application:<u>

Providing an interface and networking options for programs running on a computer.
Data here is called Data

<u>Layer 6 - Presentation:<u>

Translate the data into a standardised format that could be understood by the application layer in the receiving computer, as well as handling any encryption compression or other transformations to the data.
Data here is called Data

<u>Layer 5 - Session:<u>

Creates a unique session to the communications between the computers, sends back an error if it can't.
Data here is called Data

<u>Layer 4 - Transport:<u>

Chooses to protocol over which the data is to be transmitted, the 2 most common protocols are TCP and UDP
TCP - Reliable communication, the connection is established and maintained, this protocol is slower
UDP - Non-reliable communication, just throws the packages, faster protocol.
Data here is called Segments/Datagrams

<u>Layer 3 - Network:<u>

Responsible for locating the destination of your request by address.
Data here is called Packets

<u>Layer 2 - Data Link:<u>

Adds physical mac(which is on the nic) address to the packet which used to identify where exactly to send the information, it's also his job the present the data in a format suitable for transmission and checks that the data isn't corrupted, which could happen during the layer 1 transmission.
Data here is called Frames

<u>Layer 1 - Physical:<u>

This is where the electrical pulses that make up data transfer over a network are sent and received. Converts the binary data into signals and transmits them across the network and converts incoming signals back into binary data.
Data here is called Bits

Three-way handshake:
SYN - A special request to the remote server, indicating the computer wants to initialize a connection
SYN/ACK - The server respond with the SYN bit as well with an acknowledgement
ACK - Finally your computer will send that ACK bit by itself, confirming that the connection has been setup successfully

Data can now be reliably transmitted between the 2 computers, and any corrupted or lost data during the transmission is re-sent, leading to a connection which appears lossless.

### <u>DNS:<u>

Local cache - where the computer will search first
recursive DNS server - in case the domain isn't found in the cache
Root name server - if the requested domain isn't in the cache of the recursive DNS server

Top-Level Domain(TLD) - For the extension
Authoritative name servers - for the domain name

`dig <domain> @<dns-server-ip>` - a command for manually query recursive dns servers for domains
