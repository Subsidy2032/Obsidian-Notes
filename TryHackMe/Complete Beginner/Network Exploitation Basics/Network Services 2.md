#Networking 
**NFS:** Allows to share files and directories over a network, by mounting a file system or part of a file system to a server

### NFS Steps:

- The client will request to mount a directory from a remote host on a local directory
- The mount service will act to connect to the relevant mount daemon using RPC
- The server checks if the client has permission
- The server will return a file handle which uniquely identifies each file and directory that is on the server

### NFSD (NFS Daemon) for requesting a file parameters:

- The file handle
- The name of the file to be accessed
- The user's user ID
- The user's group ID

**NFS-Common:** A program to interact with NFS server

`/usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP]` - Show NFS shares

`sudo mount -t nfs IP:share /tmp/mount/ -nolock` - Mount a share

**root_squash:** Enabled by default on NFS shares, and prevents root access, nfsnobody is the default most low permission

**SUID:** Files with the SUID bit set can run with the owner permissions

`sudo chown root bash` - To change the owner to root

`sudo chmod +s bash` - To set a SUID

## SMTP

**VRFY:** Confirm the names of valid users
**EXPN:** Reveals the actual address of user's aliases and mailing list

_smtp_enum_ - Metasploit module to reveal a list of valid users

## MySQL

`apt install default-mysql-client` - Install MySQL client

_mysql -h [IP] -u [username] -p_ - connecting to MySQL server

**Schema:** In MySQL, physically, a _schema_ is synonymous with a _database_

### Servers:

[*] 10.10.30.59:3306 -  | information_schema |
[*] 10.10.30.59:3306 -  | mysql |
[*] 10.10.30.59:3306 -  | performance_schema |
[*] 10.10.30.59:3306 -  | sys |
