## What is Powershell

Powershell is a Windows  scripting language and shell environment built using the .NET framework.

Most Powershell commands are called cmdlets which are written in .NET, what makes Powershell somewhat object-oriented. Most cmdlets are represented using **Verb-Noun**.

Common verbs:

- Get
- Start
- StopÂ 
- Read
- Write
- New
- Out

## Basic Powershell Commands

##### Using Get-Help

`Get-Help <command name> [-Examples]` - Display information about cmdlets, and so examples if using the `-Examples` keyword.

##### Using Get-Command

`Get-Command Verb-*` or `Get-Command *-Noun` - Display all cmdlets installed on the current computer, matching the wildcard.

##### Object Manipulation

Output is an object, to manipulate the output we need to:

- Pass it to other cmdlets.
- Use specific object cmdlets to extract information.

With `|` you pass output from one cmdlet to another

##### Creating Objects From Pervious cmdlets

With `Select-Object` you can pull properties from a cmdlet output and create a new object, for example `Get-ChildItem | Select-Object -Property Mode, Name` to list the directories' mode and name.

flags to select particular information:

- first - gets the first x object.
- last - gets the last x object.
- unique - shows the unique objects.
- skip - skips x objects.

##### Filtering Objects

You can use `Where-Object` to filter based on the value of properties.

`Verb-Noun | Where-Object -Property <property name> -<operator> <value>` is the general format, or `Verb-Noun | Where-Object {$_.<property name> -<operator> <value>}` can be used to iterate trough every object passed.

`-<operator>` can be:

- `-Contains` - If any item in the property value is an exact match.
- `-EQ` - If the property value is the same as the specified one.
- `-GT` - If the property value is greater than the specified one.
- More.

##### Sort-Object

`Sort-Object` can be used to extract information more efficiently.

The format is `Verb-Noun | Sort-Object`.
