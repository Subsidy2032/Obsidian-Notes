## Basic Terminology

**Advanced Persistent Threat (APT):** A team or groups that engages in long term attack against organizations and countries.

**Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTP):** Tactic is the goal or objective, Technique is how the adversary achieves the goal, Procedure is how the technique is executed.

## ATT&CK Framework

Globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.

**MITRE ATT&CK Navigator:** For basic navigation and annotation of ATT&CK matrices, like Excel.

## CAR Knowledge Base

Cyber Analytics Repository (CAR) is based on the ATT&CK adversary model, leveraged in his pseudocode representations but also includes implementations directly targeted at specific tools in its analytics, focused on providing a set of validated and well-explained analytics.

## MITRE Engage

A framework for planning and discussing adversary engagement operations.

**Cyber Denial:** It's how we prevent the adversary's ability to conduct their operations.

**Cyber Deception:** Intentionally setting artifacts to mislead the adversary.

**Categories:**

- Prepare: Set of operations that will lead you to the desired outcome.
- Expose: Adversaries when they trigger your deployed deception activities.
- Affect: Adversaries by performing actions actions that will lead to negative actions on their operations.
- Elicit: Information by observing the adversary.
- Understand: The outcome of the operational actions.

## MITRE D3FEND

A knowledge graph of cybersecurity countermeasures, still in beta.

## ATT&CK Emulation Plans

**Center Of Threat-Informed Defense (CIDR):** Shared research of cyber threats and their TTPs by various companies and vendors from around the globe.

**Some of the companies and vendors that participate:**

- AttackIQ (founder)
- Verizon
- Microsoft (founder)
- Red Canary (founder)
- Splunk
