## Hash Values

MD5 (Message Digest): 128-bit hash

SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm): 160-bit hash

SHA-2: One variant SHA-256 - 256-bit hash

## IP Address (Easy)

Color: Green

Fast Flux: A DNS technique used by botnets to hide malicious activity behind compromised hosts acting as proxies

## Domain Names (Simple)

Color: Teal

Punycode Attack: Converting a words that can't be written in ASCII into a Unicode ASCII encoding, browsers are now really good at translating the obfuscated characters into the full Punycode domain name

**URL shortening services:**

- bit.ly
- goo.gl
- ow.ly
- s.id
- smarturl.it
- tiny.pl
- tinyurl.com
- x.co

You can view the full URL by adding a **+** at the end of the shortened URL

## Host Artifacts (Annoying)

Color: Yellow

Traces an attacker left on the system, like registry values or a file that dropped by malicious application

## Network Artifacts (Annoying)

Color: Yellow

Things like user-agent string, c2 information and URI patterns followed by the HTTP POST requests

## Tools (Challenging)

Color: Red

Fuzzy hashing: Can check for similarities between 2 hashes

## TTP (Tactics, Techniques & Procedures) (Tough)

Consists of the entire [MITRE](https://attack.mitre.org/)Â [ATT&CK Matrix](https://attack.mitre.org/), this is completely figuring out their attack
