## What is Yara?

Yara can identify information based on both binary and textual patterns, Those patterns are labeled by rules.

## Intro to Yara rules

2 arguments required for every `Yara` command:

1. The rule file we create.
2. Name of file, directory or process id we want to use the rule for.

Example - `yara myrule.yar somedirectory`

## Yara modules

Cuckoo: A sandbox that lets you generate rules based on the behaviors discovered from malware.

FENRIR: Updated version of the previous 2 tools.
