**Data:** Discrete indictors, like IP address, URLs or hashes.

**Information:** A combination of multiple data points that answer questions.

**Intelligence:** The correlation of data and information to extract pattern of action.

## Classifications

**Strategic Intel:** High level intel that looks into the organization's threat landscape, based on trends, patterns and emerging threats.

**Technical Intel:** Looks into evidence and artefacts of an attack, can be used to develop defense mechanisms.

**Tactical Intel:** Assesses adversaries' TTPs, can strengthen security controls and address vulnerabilities.

**Operational Intel:** Looks into specific motives and intent to find the target.

## CTI Lifecycle

- **Direction:** Objectives and goals should be defined, like what to protect and what resources to use to protect it.

- **Collection:** Collecting data, it is recommended to automate this step to provide time for triggering incidents.

- **Processing:** Extracting, sorting and organizing the data and making him usable and understandable, SIEM are valuable for achieving it quick.

- **Analysis:** Investigating a potential threat, Defining an action plan and Strengthening security controls.

- **Dissemination:** Different organizational stakeholders will consume the intelligence in varying languages.

- **Feedback:** Should be a regular interaction between teams.

## CTI Standards & Frameworks

- **MITRE ATT&CK**
- **The Trusted Automated eXchange of Indicator Information (TAXII):** Threat intel is collected and hosted by a producer upon request by user using a request-response model, it than pushed to users from a central server through a publish-subscribe model
- **Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX):** Language developed for the specification, capture, characterisation and communication of standardised cyber threat information, it provides defined relationship between sets of threat intel.
