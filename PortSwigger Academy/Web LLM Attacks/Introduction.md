## What is a Large Language Model?

Large Language Models (LLMs) are AI algorithms that can process user inputs and create plausible responses by predicting sequences of words. They are trained on huge semi-public data sets, using machine learning to analyze how the component parts of language fit together.

## LLM Attacks and Prompt Injection

A prompt injection is where the AI is manipulated to return unintended content, make incorrect calls to sensitive API, etc.

## Recommended Methodology for Detecting LLM Vulnerabilities

1. Identify the LLM's inputs, including both direct (such as a prompt) and indirect (such as training data) inputs.
2. Work out what data and APIs the LLM has access to.
3. Probe this new attack surface for vulnerabilities.
