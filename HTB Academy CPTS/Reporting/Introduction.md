One crucial consideration is a snapshot in time of the target network's security status. We should include an overview section in our report that talks about the type of work performed, who performed it, source IP addresses used in testing, and any special considerations (i.e., testing performed remotely over VPN or from a host within the client's network). This overview should also state that our testing was performed during a specific period and that any changes to in-scope systems and resultant vulnerabilities would not be captured in this report deliverable. We could state: "All testing activities were performed between January 7, 2022 and January 19, 2022." We could also add a disclaimer, such as "This report represents a snapshot in time during the aforementioned testing period, and Acme Consulting, LLC cannot attest to the state of any client-owned information assets outside of this testing window."
