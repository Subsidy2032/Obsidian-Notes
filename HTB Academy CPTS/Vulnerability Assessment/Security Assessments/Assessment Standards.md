## Compliance Standarts

### [Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/pci_security/)
This is a standard for organizations that deal with cardholders data, the requirements include the internal and external scanning of assets, and processing card data submitted in a Cardholder Data Environment (CDE) which is segmented from normal assets.

### [Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)](https://www.hipaa.com/)
Used to protect patients' data, doesn't require vulnerability scans or assessments, but they are needed for HIPAA accreditation.

### [Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)](https://www.cisa.gov/federal-information-security-modernization-act)
Used to safeguard government operations and information, requires organizations to provide documentation and proof of vulnerability management program, to maintain the CIA triad.

### [ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html)
Used worldwide to manage information security, and requires quarterly external and internal scans.

[ISO 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html) compliance depends upon maintaining an effective Information Security Management System. To ensure compliance, organizations must perform penetration tests in a carefully designed way.

## Penetration Testing Standards

### PTES

The [Penetration Testing Execution Standard](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Main_Page) (`PTES`) can be applied to all types of penetration tests. It outlines the phases of a penetration test and how they should be conducted. These are the sections in the PTES:

- Pre-engagement Interactions
- Intelligence Gathering
- Threat Modeling
- Vulnerability Analysis
- Exploitation
- Post Exploitation
- Reporting

### OSSTMM

`OSSTMM` is the `Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual`, another set of guidelines pentesters can use to ensure they're doing their jobs properly. It can be used alongside other pentest standards.

[OSSTMM](https://www.isecom.org/OSSTMM.3.pdf) is divided into five different channels for five different areas of pentesting:

1. Human Security (human beings are subject to social engineering exploits)
2. Physical Security
3. Wireless Communications (including but not limited to technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth)
4. Telecommunications
5. Data Networks

### NIST

The `NIST` (`National Institute of Standards and Technology`) is well known for their [NIST Cybersecurity Framework](https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework), a system for designing incident response policies and procedures. NIST also has a Penetration Testing Framework. The phases of the NIST framework include:

- Planning
- Discovery
- Attack
- Reporting

### OWASP

`OWASP` stands for the [Open Web Application Security Project](https://owasp.org). They're typically the go-to organization for defining testing standards and classifying risks to web applications.

OWASP maintains a few different standards and helpful guides for assessment various technologies:

- [Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/)
- [Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)](https://owasp.org/www-project-mobile-security-testing-guide/)
- [Firmware Security Testing Methodology](https://github.com/scriptingxss/owasp-fstm)
