## Vulnerability Assessment

Based on a particular security standard (such as GPDR or OWSAP), compliance with this standard is analyzed.

Can be performed independently or alongside other security assessments.

Vulnerability assessments are used to find vulnerabilities in networks without simulating cyber attacks and should be performed every so often, it goes through a checklist:

- Do we meet this standard?
- Do we have this configuration?

The assessor will usually perform validation on critical, high, and medium-risk vulnerabilities, he will provide prove for it not being false positive, but will not go beyond this vulnerability.

## Penetration test

[[Process]]

Pentest should only be performed after some vulnerability assessment has been conducted.

## Other Types of Security Assessments

### Security Audits

Security audits come by surprise, usually mandated by the government agencies or industry associations, to assure that an organization is compliant with specific security regulations.

For example the [PCI-DSS "Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard"](https://www.pcicomplianceguide.org/faq/#1) is enforced by the [Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council](https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org) for service providers who except major credit cards.
