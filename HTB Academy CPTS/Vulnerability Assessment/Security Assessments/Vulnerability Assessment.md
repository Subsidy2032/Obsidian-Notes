In vulnerability assessment there may be little manual exploitation just to find false positives, or there might be no manual exploitation at all.

## Methodology

### 1. Conduct Risk Identification and Analysis
Make a complete list of IT equipment, and assign risk to each asset.

### 2. Develop Vulnerability Scanning Policies
Should have a responsible official owner, and should be approved by upper management.

### 3. Identify the Type of Scans
Types of scans include network, host based, wireless based, and applications.

### 4. Configure The Scan
Add target IPs list, define port ranges and protocols, define the targets, aggressivness, time, and notifications.

### 5. Perform the Scan
The tool will fingerprint the targets for basic information, than with this it will gather more detailed specifications, such as ports and services running.

### 6. Evaluate and Consider Possible Risks
Pertain mostly to the availability of the target, in case the links and connections can't handle the load of the scan, it can shut down and become unavailable.

### 7. Interpret the Scan Results
For example you will prioritize a vulnerability with public exploit.

### 8. Create a Remediation & Mitigation Plan
The information security and IT staff should communicate and work closely together, to streamline the resolution process.

## Asset Management

### Asset Inventory

An organization should keep an inventory of IT, operational security, physical, software, mobile, and development assets with data classifications to ensure adequate security and access controls.

### Application and System Inventory

An organization should create a thorough and complete inventory of data assets for proper asset management for defensive security. Data assets include:

- All data stored on-premises. HDDs and SSDs in endpoints (PCs and mobile devices), HDDs & SSDs in servers, external drives in the local network, optical media (DVDs, Blu-ray discs, CDs), flash media (USB sticks, SD cards). Legacy technology may include floppy disks, ZIP drives (a relic from the 1990s), and tape drives.
    
- All of the data storage that their cloud provider possesses. [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com) (`AWS`), [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com) (`GCP`), and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) are some of the most popular cloud providers, but there are many more. Sometimes corporate networks are "multi-cloud," meaning they have more than one cloud provider. A company's cloud provider will provide tools that can be used to inventory all of the data stored by that particular cloud provider.
    
- All data stored within various `Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)` applications. This data is also "in the cloud" but might not all be within the scope of a corporate cloud provider account. These are often consumer services or the "business" version of those services. Think of online services such as `Google Drive`, `Dropbox`, `Microsoft Teams`, `Apple iCloud`, `Adobe Creative Suite`, `Microsoft Office 365`, `Google Docs`, and the list goes on.
    
- All of the applications a company needs to use to conduct their usual operation and business. Including applications that are deployed locally and applications that are deployed through the cloud or are otherwise Software-as-a-Service.
    
- All of a company's on-premises computer networking devices. These include but aren't limited to `routers`, `firewalls`, `hubs`, `switches`, dedicated `intrusion detection` and `prevention systems` (`IDS/IPS`), `data loss prevention` (`DLP`) systems, and so on.
