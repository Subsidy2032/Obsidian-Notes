The [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/) is an industry standard for calculating the severity ratings of vulnerabilities, it's often used together with [Microsoft DREAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAD_(risk_assessment_model)) which is used to help IT security professionals to evaluate the severity of security threats and vulnerabilities, those are the main factors:

- Damage Potential
- Reproducibility
- Exploitability
- Affected Users
- Discoverability

## Risk Scoring

The scoring consists of exploitability and impact, the exploitability measurements consist of access vector, access complexity, and authentication. The impact metrics consist of the CIA triad.

## Base Metric Group

### Exploitability Metrics

Used to evaluate technical means needed for exploitation, using the metrics below:

- Attack Vector
- Attack Complexity
- Privileges Required
- User Interaction

### Impact Metrics

The impact of successful exploitation:
![[cia_triad.png]]

## Temporal Metric Group

Details the availability of exploits or patches regarding the issue.

### Exploit Code Maturity

The probability of exploitation based on ease.

**Not Defined:** This metric is skipped.
**High:** An exploit consistently working for the issue, and easily identifiable with automated tools.
**Functional:** Exploit code is available.
**Proof-of-Concept:** PoC exploit code is available, but would require changes.
**Unproven**

### Remediation Level

Used to identify the prioritization of a vulnerability.

**Not Defined:** This metric is skipped.
**Unavailable:** There is no patch available for the vulnerability.
**Workaround:** Unofficial solution is released, until an official patch.
**Temporary Fix:** An official vendor has provided a temporary solution.
**Official Fix:** Vendor has released an official fix.

### Report Confidence

Represents the validation of the vulnerability and how accurate the technical details of the issue are.

**Not Defined:** This metric is skipped.
**Confirmed:** There are various sources with detailed information confirming the vulnerability.
**Reasonable:** Sources have released information, but there is no confidence about reproduction of the exploit.
**Unknown**

## Environmental Metric Group

Represents the significance of the vulnerability of an organization, taking into account the CIA triad.

### Modified Base Metrics

Represents the metrics that can be altered, if the organization deems a more significant risk in the CIA triad.

**Not Defined:** This metric is skipped.
**High:** One of the elements of the CIA triad would have astronomical effects on the organization and costumers.
**Medium:** One of the elements of the CIA triad would have a significant effects on the organization and costumers.
**Low:** One of the elements of the CIA triad would have a minimal effects on the organization and costumers.

## Calculating CVSS Sevirity

The calculation of a CVSS v3.1 score takes into account all the metrics discussed in this section. The National Vulnerability Database has a calculator available to the public [here](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator).
