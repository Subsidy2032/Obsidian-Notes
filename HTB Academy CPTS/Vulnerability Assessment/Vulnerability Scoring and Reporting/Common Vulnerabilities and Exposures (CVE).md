## Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)

OVAL is a publicly available information security international standard used to evaluate and detail the system's current state of issues. OVAL is also co-supported by the office of Cybersecurity and Communications from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. OVAL provides a language to understand encoding system attributes and various content repositories shared within the security community. The OVAL repository has over 7000+ definitions for public use. Additionally, OVAL is also used by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) which brings together community ideas for automating vulnerability management, measurement, and ensuring systems meet policy compliance.

### OVAL Process
![[VulnerabilityAssessment_Diagram_05.png]]

The goal of the OVAL language is to have a three-step structure during the assessment process that consists of:

- Identifying a system's configurations for testing
- Evaluating the current system's state
- Disclosing the information in a report

The information can be described in various types of states, including: `Vulnerable`, `Non-compliant`, `Installed Asset`, and `Patched`.

### OVAL Definitions

Recorded in an XML format to discover any software vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, programs, and additional system information taking out the need to exploit a system, which gives the ability to correlate which systems need to be patched in a network.

Four main classes of OVAL definitions:

- `OVAL Vulnerability Definitions`: Identifies system vulnerabilities
- `OVAL Compliance Definitions`: Identifies if current system configurations meet system policy requirements
- `OVAL Inventory Definitions`: Evaluates a system to see if a specific software is present
- `OVAL Patch Definitions`: Identifies if a system has the appropriate patch

Additionally, the `OVAL ID Format` consist of a unique format that consists of "oval:Organization Domain Name:ID Type:ID Value". The `ID Type` can fall into various categories including: definition (`def`), object (`obj`), state (`ste`), and variable (`var`). An example of a unique identifier would be `oval:org.mitre.oval:obj:1116`.

Scanners such as Nessus have the ability to use OVAL to configure security compliance scanning templates.

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

[Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)](https://cve.mitre.org/) is a publicly available catalog of security issues sponsored by the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Each CVE has a unique ID assigned by the CVE Numbering Authority (CNA).

### Stages of Obtaining a CVE

#### Stage 1: Identify if CVE is Required and Relevant
Identify if the issue find is a vulnerability, meaning a code that can be exploited, resulting in a negative impact to the CIA triad, and that requires coding changes, specification changes, or specification deprecation to mitigate or address. Additionally research should verify there is not a CVE ID already in the database.

#### Stage 2: Reach Out to Affected Product Vendor
Good faith effort, Researchers can reference CVE's [Documents on Disclosure Practices](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/researcher_reservation_guidelines#appendix#a) for additional information.

#### Stage 3: Identify if Request Should Be for Vendor CNA or Third Party CNA
If a company is a part of participating CNA's, they can assign CVE ID for one of their products, the appropriate CNA organization can be contacted [here](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/request_id.html). If the vendor is not a participating CNA, a researcher should attempt to reach out to the vendor's third-party coordinator.

#### Stage 4: Requesting CVE ID Through CVE Web Form
The CVE Team has a form that can be filled out online [here](https://cveform.mitre.org/) if the methods above do not work for CVE requests.

#### Stage 5: Confirmation of CVE Form
After the following step an individual will receive a confirmation email, the CVE team will contact the requester if any additional information is required.

#### Stage 6: Receival of CVE ID
The CVE team will notify the requester of a CVE ID if the vulnerability is confirmed, the CVE ID is not public yet in this stage.

#### Stage 7: Public Disclosure of CVE ID
CVE IDs can be announced to the public as soon as the parties are aware of the issue to prevent duplication, this stage ensures all associated parties are aware before public disclosure.

#### Stage 8: Announcing the CVE
The CVE team asks researches who are sharing multiple CVEs to ensure each CVE indicated the different vulnerabilities, Additional information can be found [here](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/researcher_reservation_guidelines).

#### Stage 9: Providing Information to the CVE Team
At this stage, the CVE Team asks that the researcher help provide additional information to be used in the official CVE listing on the website. The [U.S. National Vulnerability Database (NVD)](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintains this information online in their database as well.
