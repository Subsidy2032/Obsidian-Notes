Most tools run a combination of static and dynamic tests.

**Static tests:** Would determine a vulnerability if the version of the asset have a public CVE, it isn't always accurate since the target might not be specifically vulnerable, or a patch might is applied.
**Dynamic tests:** Tries specific (usually benign) payloads such as weak credentials, SQL injection, or command injection on the target, and checks for hits.

Organizations should run both `unauthenticated and authenticated scans` on a continuous schedule to ensure that assets are patched as new vulnerabilities are discovered and that any new assets added to the network do not have missing patches or other configuration/patching issues. Vulnerability scanning should feed into an organization's [patch management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_(computing)) program.
