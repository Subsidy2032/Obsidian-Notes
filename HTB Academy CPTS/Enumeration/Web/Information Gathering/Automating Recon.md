While manual reconnaissance can be effective, it can also be time-consuming and prone to human error. Automating web reconnaissance tasks can significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy, allowing you to gather information at scale and identify potential vulnerabilities more rapidly.

## Why Automate Reconnaissance?

Automation offers several key advantages for web reconnaissance:

- `Efficiency`: Automated tools can perform repetitive tasks much faster than humans, freeing up valuable time for analysis and decision-making.
- `Scalability`: Automation allows you to scale your reconnaissance efforts across a large number of targets or domains, uncovering a broader scope of information.
- `Consistency`: Automated tools follow predefined rules and procedures, ensuring consistent and reproducible results and minimising the risk of human error.
- `Comprehensive Coverage`: Automation can be programmed to perform a wide range of reconnaissance tasks, including DNS enumeration, subdomain discovery, web crawling, port scanning, and more, ensuring thorough coverage of potential attack vectors.
- `Integration`: Many automation frameworks allow for easy integration with other tools and platforms, creating a seamless workflow from reconnaissance to vulnerability assessment and exploitation.

## Reconnaissance Frameworks

These frameworks aim to provide a complete suite of tools for web reconnaissance:

- [FinalRecon](https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/FinalRecon): A Python-based reconnaissance tool offering a range of modules for different tasks like SSL certificate checking, Whois information gathering, header analysis, and crawling. Its modular structure enables easy customisation for specific needs.
- [Recon-ng](https://github.com/lanmaster53/recon-ng): A powerful framework written in Python that offers a modular structure with various modules for different reconnaissance tasks. It can perform DNS enumeration, subdomain discovery, port scanning, web crawling, and even exploit known vulnerabilities.
- [theHarvester](https://github.com/laramies/theHarvester): Specifically designed for gathering email addresses, subdomains, hosts, employee names, open ports, and banners from different public sources like search engines, PGP key servers, and the SHODAN database. It is a command-line tool written in Python.
- [SpiderFoot](https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot): An open-source intelligence automation tool that integrates with various data sources to collect information about a target, including IP addresses, domain names, email addresses, and social media profiles. It can perform DNS lookups, web crawling, port scanning, and more.
- [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com/): A collection of various tools and resources for open-source intelligence gathering. It covers a wide range of information sources, including social media, search engines, public records, and more.

### FinalRecon

`FinalRecon` offers a wealth of recon information:

- `Header Information`: Reveals server details, technologies used, and potential security misconfigurations.
- `Whois Lookup`: Uncovers domain registration details, including registrant information and contact details.
- `SSL Certificate Information`: Examines the SSL/TLS certificate for validity, issuer, and other relevant details.
- `Crawler`:
    - HTML, CSS, JavaScript: Extracts links, resources, and potential vulnerabilities from these files.
    - Internal/External Links: Maps out the website's structure and identifies connections to other domains.
    - Images, robots.txt, sitemap.xml: Gathers information about allowed/disallowed crawling paths and website structure.
    - Links in JavaScript, Wayback Machine: Uncovers hidden links and historical website data.
- `DNS Enumeration`: Queries over 40 DNS record types, including DMARC records for email security assessment.
- `Subdomain Enumeration`: Leverages multiple data sources (crt.sh, AnubisDB, ThreatMiner, CertSpotter, Facebook API, VirusTotal API, Shodan API, BeVigil API) to discover subdomains.
- `Directory Enumeration`: Supports custom wordlists and file extensions to uncover hidden directories and files.
- `Wayback Machine`: Retrieves URLs from the last five years to analyse website changes and potential vulnerabilities.

Installation is quick and easy:
```shell-session
$ git clone https://github.com/thewhiteh4t/FinalRecon.git
$ cd FinalRecon
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
$ chmod +x ./finalrecon.py
$ ./finalyrecon.py --help
```

For instance, if we want `FinalRecon` to gather header information and perform a Whois lookup for `inlanefreight.com`, we would use the corresponding flags (`--headers` and `--whois`), so the command would be:
```shell-session
$ ./finalrecon.py --headers --whois --url http://inlanefreight.com
