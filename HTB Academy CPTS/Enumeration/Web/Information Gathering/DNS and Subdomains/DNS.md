## How DNS Works

Imagine you want to visit a website like `www.example.com`. You type this friendly domain name into your browser, but your computer doesn't understand words – it speaks the language of numbers, specifically IP addresses. So, how does your computer find the website's IP address? Enter DNS, the internet's trusty translator.

1. `Your Computer Asks for Directions (DNS Query)`: When you enter the domain name, your computer first checks its memory (cache) to see if it remembers the IP address from a previous visit. If not, it reaches out to a DNS resolver, usually provided by your internet service provider (ISP).
    
2. `The DNS Resolver Checks its Map (Recursive Lookup)`: The resolver also has a cache, and if it doesn't find the IP address there, it starts a journey through the DNS hierarchy. It begins by asking a root name server, which is like the librarian of the internet.
    
3. `Root Name Server Points the Way`: The root server doesn't know the exact address but knows who does – the Top-Level Domain (TLD) name server responsible for the domain's ending (e.g., .com, .org). It points the resolver in the right direction.
    
4. `TLD Name Server Narrows It Down`: The TLD name server is like a regional map. It knows which authoritative name server is responsible for the specific domain you're looking for (e.g., `example.com`) and sends the resolver there.
    
5. `Authoritative Name Server Delivers the Address`: The authoritative name server is the final stop. It's like the street address of the website you want. It holds the correct IP address and sends it back to the resolver.
    
6. `The DNS Resolver Returns the Information`: The resolver receives the IP address and gives it to your computer. It also remembers it for a while (caches it), in case you want to revisit the website soon.
    
7. `Your Computer Connects`: Now that your computer knows the IP address, it can connect directly to the web server hosting the website, and you can start browsing.

## The Hosts File

The `hosts` file is a simple text file used to map hostnames to IP addresses, providing a manual method of domain name resolution that bypasses the DNS process. While DNS automates the translation of domain names to IP addresses, the `hosts` file allows for direct, local overrides. This can be particularly useful for development, troubleshooting, or blocking websites.

The `hosts` file is located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows and in `/etc/hosts` on Linux and MacOS. Each line in the file follows the format:
```txt
<IP Address>    <Hostname> [<Alias> ...]
```

To edit the `hosts` file, open it with a text editor using administrative/root privileges.

Common uses include redirecting a domain to a local server for development:
```txt
127.0.0.1       myapp.local
```

testing connectivity by specifying an IP address:
```txt
192.168.1.20    testserver.local
```

or blocking unwanted websites by redirecting their domains to a non-existent IP address:
```txt
0.0.0.0       unwanted-site.com
```

## Key DNS Concepts

In the `Domain Name System` (`DNS`), a `zone` is a distinct part of the domain namespace that a specific entity or administrator manages. Think of it as a virtual container for a set of domain names. For example, `example.com` and all its subdomains (like `mail.example.com` or `blog.example.com`) would typically belong to the same DNS zone.

The zone file, a text file residing on a DNS server, defines the resource records (discussed below) within this zone, providing crucial information for translating domain names into IP addresses.

To illustrate, here's a simplified example of what a zone file, for `example.com` might look like:
```dns-zone
$TTL 3600 ; Default Time-To-Live (1 hour)
@       IN SOA   ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. (
                2024060401 ; Serial number (YYYYMMDDNN)
                3600       ; Refresh interval
                900        ; Retry interval
                604800     ; Expire time
                86400 )    ; Minimum TTL

@       IN NS    ns1.example.com.
@       IN NS    ns2.example.com.
@       IN MX 10 mail.example.com.
www     IN A     192.0.2.1
mail    IN A     198.51.100.1
ftp     IN CNAME www.example.com.
```

This file defines the authoritative name servers (`NS` records), mail server (`MX` record), and IP addresses (`A` records) for various hosts within the `example.com` domain.

DNS servers store various resource records, each serving a specific purpose in the domain name resolution process. Let's explore some of the most common DNS concepts:

|DNS Concept|Description|Example|
|---|---|---|
|`Domain Name`|A human-readable label for a website or other internet resource.|`www.example.com`|
|`IP Address`|A unique numerical identifier assigned to each device connected to the internet.|`192.0.2.1`|
|`DNS Resolver`|A server that translates domain names into IP addresses.|Your ISP's DNS server or public resolvers like Google DNS (`8.8.8.8`)|
|`Root Name Server`|The top-level servers in the DNS hierarchy.|There are 13 root servers worldwide, named A-M: `a.root-servers.net`|
|`TLD Name Server`|Servers responsible for specific top-level domains (e.g., .com, .org).|[Verisign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verisign) for `.com`, [PIR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Interest_Registry) for `.org`|
|`Authoritative Name Server`|The server that holds the actual IP address for a domain.|Often managed by hosting providers or domain registrars.|
|`DNS Record Types`|Different types of information stored in DNS.|A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, TXT, etc.|

DNS record types:

|Record Type|Full Name|Description|Zone File Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|`A`|Address Record|Maps a hostname to its IPv4 address.|`www.example.com.` IN A `192.0.2.1`|
|`AAAA`|IPv6 Address Record|Maps a hostname to its IPv6 address.|`www.example.com.` IN AAAA `2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334`|
|`CNAME`|Canonical Name Record|Creates an alias for a hostname, pointing it to another hostname.|`blog.example.com.` IN CNAME `webserver.example.net.`|
|`MX`|Mail Exchange Record|Specifies the mail server(s) responsible for handling email for the domain.|`example.com.` IN MX 10 `mail.example.com.`|
|`NS`|Name Server Record|Delegates a DNS zone to a specific authoritative name server.|`example.com.` IN NS `ns1.example.com.`|
|`TXT`|Text Record|Stores arbitrary text information, often used for domain verification or security policies.|`example.com.` IN TXT `"v=spf1 mx -all"` (SPF record)|
|`SOA`|Start of Authority Record|Specifies administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server, responsible person's email, and other parameters.|`example.com.` IN SOA `ns1.example.com. admin.example.com. 2024060301 10800 3600 604800 86400`|
|`SRV`|Service Record|Defines the hostname and port number for specific services.|`_sip._udp.example.com.` IN SRV 10 5 5060 `sipserver.example.com.`|
|`PTR`|Pointer Record|Used for reverse DNS lookups, mapping an IP address to a hostname.|

The "`IN`" in the examples stands for "Internet." It's a class field in DNS records that specifies the protocol family. In most cases, you'll see "`IN`" used, as it denotes the Internet protocol suite (IP) used for most domain names. Other class values exist (e.g., `CH` for Chaosnet, `HS` for Hesiod) but are rarely used in modern DNS configurations. In essence, "`IN`" is simply a convention that indicates that the record applies to the standard internet protocols we use today.

## Why DNS Matters for Web Recon

DNS is not merely a technical protocol for translating domain names; it's a critical component of a target's infrastructure that can be leveraged to uncover vulnerabilities and gain access during a penetration test:

- `Uncovering Assets`: DNS records can reveal a wealth of information, including subdomains, mail servers, and name server records. For instance, a `CNAME` record pointing to an outdated server (`dev.example.com` CNAME `oldserver.example.net`) could lead to a vulnerable system.
- `Mapping the Network Infrastructure`: You can create a comprehensive map of the target's network infrastructure by analysing DNS data. For example, identifying the name servers (`NS` records) for a domain can reveal the hosting provider used, while an `A` record for `loadbalancer.example.com` can pinpoint a load balancer. This helps you understand how different systems are connected, identify traffic flow, and pinpoint potential choke points or weaknesses that could be exploited during a penetration test.
- `Monitoring for Changes`: Continuously monitoring DNS records can reveal changes in the target's infrastructure over time. For example, the sudden appearance of a new subdomain (`vpn.example.com`) might indicate a new entry point into the network, while a `TXT` record containing a value like `_1password=...` strongly suggests the organization is using 1Password, which could be leveraged for social engineering attacks or targeted phishing campaigns.

```

This output is the result of a DNS query using the `dig` command for the domain `google.com`. The command was executed on a system running `DiG` version `9.18.24-0ubuntu0.22.04.1-Ubuntu`. The output can be broken down into four key sections:

1. Header
    
    - `;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 16449`: This line indicates the type of query (`QUERY`), the successful status (`NOERROR`), and a unique identifier (`16449`) for this specific query.
        
        - `;; flags: qr rd ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0`: This describes the flags in the DNS header:
            - `qr`: Query Response flag - indicates this is a response.
            - `rd`: Recursion Desired flag - means recursion was requested.
            - `ad`: Authentic Data flag - means the resolver considers the data authentic.
            - The remaining numbers indicate the number of entries in each section of the DNS response: 1 question, 1 answer, 0 authority records, and 0 additional records.
    - `;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available`: This indicates that recursion was requested, but the server does not support it.
        
2. Question Section
    
    - `;google.com. IN A`: This line specifies the question: "What is the IPv4 address (A record) for `google.com`?"
3. Answer Section
    
    - `google.com. 0 IN A 142.251.47.142`: This is the answer to the query. It indicates that the IP address associated with `google.com` is `142.251.47.142`. The '`0`' represents the `TTL` (time-to-live), indicating how long the result can be cached before being refreshed.
4. Footer
    
    - `;; Query time: 0 msec`: This shows the time it took for the query to be processed and the response to be received (0 milliseconds).
        
    - `;; SERVER: 172.23.176.1#53(172.23.176.1) (UDP)`: This identifies the DNS server that provided the answer and the protocol used (UDP).
        
    - `;; WHEN: Thu Jun 13 10:45:58 SAST 2024`: This is the timestamp of when the query was made.
        
    - `;; MSG SIZE rcvd: 54`: This indicates the size of the DNS message received (54 bytes).
        

An `opt pseudosection` can sometimes exist in a `dig` query. This is due to Extension Mechanisms for DNS (`EDNS`), which allows for additional features such as larger message sizes and DNS Security Extensions (`DNSSEC`) support.

If you just want the answer to the question, without any of the other information, you can query `dig` using `+short`:
```shell-session
$ dig +short hackthebox.com

104.18.20.126
104.18.21.126
```
