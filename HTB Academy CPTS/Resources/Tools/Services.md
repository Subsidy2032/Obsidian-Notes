[Subfinder](https://github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder): Can scrape subdomains from open sources like [DNSdumpster](https://dnsdumpster.com/)

[Sublist3r](https://github.com/aboul3la/Sublist3r): Can be used to brute force subdomains

[Subbrute](https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute): allows us to use self-defined resolvers and perform pure DNS brute forcing attacks during internal penetration tests on hosts that don't have internet access
