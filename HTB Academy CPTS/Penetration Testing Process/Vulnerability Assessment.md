Analysis types:

|**Analysis Type**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`Descriptive`|Descriptive analysis is essential in any data analysis. On the one hand, it describes a data set based on individual characteristics. It helps to detect possible errors in data collection or outliers in the data set.|
|`Diagnostic`|Diagnostic analysis clarifies conditions' causes, effects, and interactions. Doing so provides insights that are obtained through correlations and interpretation. We must take a backward-looking view, similar to descriptive analysis, with the subtle difference that we try to find reasons for events and developments.|
|`Predictive`|By evaluating historical and current data, predictive analysis creates a predictive model for future probabilities. Based on the results of descriptive and diagnostic analyses, this method of data analysis makes it possible to identify trends, detect deviations from expected values at an early stage, and predict future occurrences as accurately as possible.|
|`Prescriptive`|Prescriptive analytics aims to narrow down what actions to take to eliminate or prevent a future problem or trigger a specific activity or process.|

Example of conclusions on TCP 2121 open port (the only one):
- a `TCP` port `2121`. - `TCP` already means that this service is `connection-oriented`.
    
- Is this a `standard` port? - `No`, because these are between `0-1023`, aka well-known or [system ports](https://www.iana.org/assignments/service-names-port-numbers/service-names-port-numbers.xhtml)
    
- Are there any numbers in this `port number` that look `familiar`? - `Yes`, `TCP` port `21` (`FTP`). From our experience, we will get to know many standard ports and their services, which administrators often try to disguise, but often use "easy to remember" alternatives.

While connecting to the service, we noticed that the connection took longer than usual (about 15 seconds). There are some services whose connection speed, or response time, can be configured. Now that we know that an FTP server is running on this port, we can deduce the origin of our "failed" scan. We could confirm this again by specifying the minimum `probe round trip time` (`--min-rtt-timeout`) in Nmap to 15 or 20 seconds and rerunning the scan.

## Assessment of Possible Attack Vectors

In case we need to test our client covertly and avoid alerts, we might replicate the target system and look for vulnerabilities locally, using the information gathered during the information gathering phase.
