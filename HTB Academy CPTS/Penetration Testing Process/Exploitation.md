Things to look for when prioritizing attacks:
- Probability of Success
- Complexity
- Probability of Damage

[CVSS Scoring](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss) can help with the probability of successfully execute a particular attack, [NVD calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator) is better for a specific attack.

Prioritization example:

|**Factor**|**Points**|**Remote File Inclusion**|**Buffer Overflow**|
|---|---|---|---|
|1. Probability of Success|`10`|10|8|
|2. Complexity - Easy|`5`|4|0|
|3. Complexity - Medium|`3`|0|3|
|4. Complexity - Hard|`1`|0|0|
|5. Probability of Damage|`-5`|0|-5|
|**Summary**|`max. 15`|14|6|

We will prefer the Remote File Inclusion attack.

## Preparation for the Attack

We might replicate our target system locally in a VM as accurate as possible (same services, version numbers, etc), to test the attack for the specific configuration and confirm that it doesn't cause any demage.
