## Evasive Testing

In evasive testing we will try to go undetected and see where they have gaps in the detecting and monitoring, and in what case they detected us.

Three categories of evasive testing:

- **Evasive**
- **Hybrid Evasive**
- **Non-Evasive**

Tow or more might be combined together.

## Information Gathering

After the Exploitation phase we find our self in a new environment, internal rather than external, so it's important to collect more information from this position.

## Pillaging

In this stage we examine the role of the host in the corporate network, it can give us alternative sub-domains, whether the host is connected to other hosts, if we can use credentials or SSH keys to further our access or maintain persistence, etc. For example we can look for policies like a password policy.

Network configuration to analyze (not limited):

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Interfaces|Routing|DNS|
|ARP|Services|VPN|
|IP Subnets|Shares|Network Traffic|

## Persistence

An important stage that is often used before information gathering and pillaging.

## Vulnerability Assessment

Should be repeated when inside the system.

## Privilege Escalation

Doesn't have to occur locally on the system.

## Data Exfiltration

Often we will make fake data based on the real data. to test the preventive mechanisms of data exfiltration.

Data security regulations:

|**Type of Information**|**Security Regulation**|
|---|---|
|Credit Card Account Information|`Payment Card Industry` (`PCI`)|
|Electronic Patient Health Information|`Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act` (`HIPAA`)|
|Consumers Private Banking Information|`Gramm-Leach-Bliley` (`GLBA`)|
|Government Information|`Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002` (`FISMA`)|

Frameworks companies may follow:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|(`NIST`) - National Institute of Standards and Technology|(`CIS Controls`) - Center for Internet Security Controls|
|(`ISO`) - International Organization for Standardization|(`PCI-DSS`) - The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard|
|(`GDPR`) - General Data Protection Regulation|(`COBIT`) - Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies|
|(`FedRAMP`) - The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program|(`ITAR`) - International Traffic in Arms Regulations|
|(`AICPA`) - American Institute of Certified Public Accountants|(`NERC CIP Standards`) - NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection Standards|

It's important to make proves like screenshots at this stage.
