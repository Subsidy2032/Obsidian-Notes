Proof-of-Concept can come for example in the form of executing `calc.exe`, detailing the steps you took to exploit the system and a script or code that automatically exploits the system.

However administrators should work with the script and follow it steps to fix vulnerabilities and not just make sure that this specific script doesn't work.

For example there might be a chain of vulnerabilities, that fixing one of them wouldn't fix all the issues. Another example is that if a weak password is found, the problem is not the account with this password, but rather the password policy.
