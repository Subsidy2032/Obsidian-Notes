This note is the continuation of the [[Attacks/Linux/Privilege Escalation/Introduction|Introduction]] note.

## Gaining Situational Awareness

Our enumeration can be a little bit different depending on the Linux host we land on (CentOS host or Red Hat Enterprise Linux host vs Debian-based host such as Ubuntu). If we land on a host such as FreeBSD, Solaris, or something more obscure such as the HP proprietary OS HP-UX or the IBM OS AIX, the commands we would work with will likely be different. But the principles are still the same.

There are many cheat sheets available to help with enumerating Linux systems, yet it's important to have an understanding of the commands.

Typically we will want to run a few basic commands to orient ourselves:

- `whoami` - what user are we running as
- `id` - what groups does our user belong to?
- `hostname` - what is the server named. can we gather anything from the naming convention?
- `ifconfig` or `ip -a` - what subnet did we land in, does the host have additional NICs in other subnets?
- `sudo -l` - can our user run anything with sudo (as another user as root) without needing a password? This can sometimes be the easiest win and we can do something like `sudo su` and drop right into a root shell.

Including screenshots of the above information can be helpful in a client report to provide evidence of a successful Remote Code Execution (RCE) and to clearly identify the affected system.

We'll start by checking out what operating system and version we are dealing with:
```shell-session
$ cat /etc/os-release

NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS"
VERSION_ID="20.04"
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
VERSION_CODENAME=focal
UBUNTU_CODENAME=focal
```

We can see that the target is running [Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS ("Focal Fossa")](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/). It's important to check if the version we found is out-of-date or maintained. Ubuntu publishes its [release cycle](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle) and from this we can see that "Focal Fossa" does not reach end of life until April 2030. So it's unlikely to encounter a well-known kernel vulnerability.

Next we'll check out our current user's path, which is where Linux system looks every time a command is executed for any executables to match the name of what we type:
```shell-session
$ echo $PATH

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
```

We can also check out all environment variables that are set for our current user, we may get lucky and find something sensitive in there such as a password. We'll note this down and move on:
```shell-session
$ env

SHELL=/bin/bash
PWD=/home/htb-student
LOGNAME=htb-student
XDG_SESSION_TYPE=tty
MOTD_SHOWN=pam
HOME=/home/htb-student
LANG=en_US.UTF-8

<SNIP>
```

Next let's note down the Kernel version. We can then search for a public exploit PoC. We can do this in various ways like `cat /proc/version` or `uname -a`:
```shell-session
$ uname -a

Linux nixlpe02 5.4.0-122-generic #138-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jun 22 15:00:31 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

We can next gather some additional information about the host itself such as the CPU type/version:
```shell-session
$ lscpu 

Architecture:                    x86_64
CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit

On-line CPU(s) list:             0,1
Thread(s) per core:              1
Core(s) per socket:              2
Socket(s):                       1
NUMA node(s):                    1

Stepping:                        0
CPU MHz:                         2994.375

Hypervisor vendor:               VMware

<SNIP>
```

What login shells exist on the server? Note these down and highlight that both Tmux and Screen are available to us:
```shell-session
$ cat /etc/shells

# /etc/shells: valid login shells
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/rbash
/bin/dash
/usr/bin/dash
/usr/bin/tmux
/usr/bin/screen
```

We should also check to see if any defenses are in place and we can enumerate any information about them. Some things to look for include:

- [Exec Shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exec_Shield)
- [iptables](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables)
- [AppArmor](https://apparmor.net/)
- [SELinux](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux)
- [Fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban)
- [Snort](https://www.snort.org/faq/what-is-snort)
- [Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall)

Often we will not have the privileges to enumerate the configurations of these protections but knowing what, if any, are in place, can help us not to waste time on certain tasks.

Next we can look at any drives and any shares on the system, with the command below we can enumerate information about block devices on the system (hard disks, USB drives, optical drives, etc.). If we discover and can mount an additional drive or unmounted file system, we may find sensitive files, passwords, or backups that can be leveraged to escalate privileges:
```shell-session
$ lsblk

NAME                      MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
loop0                       7:0    0   55M  1 loop /snap/core18/1705

```

The command `lpstat` can be used to find information about any printers attached to the system. If there are active or queued print jobs can we gain access to some sort of sensitive information?

We should also checked for mounted drives and unmounted drives. Can we mount an umounted drive and gain access to sensitive data? Can we find any types of credentials in `fstab` for mounted drives by grepping for common words such as password, username, credential, etc in `/etc/fstab`?
```shell-session
$ cat /etc/fstab

# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
# / was on /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv during curtin installation
/dev/disk/by-id/dm-uuid-LVM-BdLsBLE4CvzJUgtkugkof4S0dZG7gWR8HCNOlRdLWoXVOba2tYUMzHfFQAP9ajul / ext4 defaults 0 0
# /boot was on /dev/sda2 during curtin installation
/dev/disk/by-uuid/20b1770d-a233-4780-900e-7c99bc974346 /boot ext4 defaults 0 0
```

Check out the routing table by typing `route` or `netstat -rn`. Here we can see what other networks are available via which interface:
```shell-session
$ route

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         _gateway        0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 ens192
10.129.0.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 ens192
```

In a domain environment we'll definitely want to check `/etc/resolv.conf` if the host is configured to use internal DNS we may be able to use this as a starting point to query the Active Directory environment.

We'll also want to check the arp table to see what other hosts the target has been communicating with:
```shell-session
$ arp -a

_gateway (10.129.0.1) at 00:50:56:b9:b9:fc [ether] on ens192
```

Users are often configured during the installation of applications and services to limit the service's privileges. We can check the `/etc/passwd` for information about users, such as:

1. Username
2. Password
3. User ID (UID)
4. Group ID (GID)
5. User ID info
6. Home directory
7. Shell

### Existing Users
```shell-session
$ cat /etc/passwd

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
daemon:x:1:1:daemon:/usr/sbin:/usr/sbin/nologin
bin:x:2:2:bin:/bin:/usr/sbin/nologin

logger:x:1005:1005::/home/logger:/bin/sh
shared:x:1006:1006::/home/shared:/bin/sh
stacey.jenkins:x:1007:1007::/home/stacey.jenkins:/bin/bash
htb-student:x:1008:1008::/home/htb-student:/bin/bash
<SNIP>
```

We might also see password hashes directly in this file. This configuration, while not common, can sometimes be seen on embedded devices and routers.

```shell-session
$ cat /etc/passwd | cut -f1 -d:

root
daemon
bin
sys

...SNIP...

mrb3n
lxd
bjones
administrator.ilfreight
backupsvc
cliff.moore
logger
shared
stacey.jenkins
htb-student
```

With Linux, several different hash algorithms can be used to make the passwords unrecognizable. Identifying them from the first hash blocks can help us to use and work with them later if needed. Here is a list of the most used ones:

|**Algorithm**|**Hash**|
|---|---|
|Salted MD5|`$1$`...|
|SHA-256|`$5$`...|
|SHA-512|`$6$`...|
|BCrypt|`$2a$`...|
|Scrypt|`$7$`...|
|Argon2|`$argon2i$`...|

We'll also want to check which users have login shells. Once we see what shells are on the system, we can check each version for vulnerabilities. Because outdated versions, such as Bash version 4.1, are vulnerable to a `shellshock` exploit:
```shell-session
$ grep "*sh$" /etc/passwd

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
mrb3n:x:1000:1000:mrb3n:/home/mrb3n:/bin/bash
bjones:x:1001:1001::/home/bjones:/bin/sh
administrator.ilfreight:x:1002:1002::/home/administrator.ilfreight:/bin/sh
backupsvc:x:1003:1003::/home/backupsvc:/bin/sh
cliff.moore:x:1004:1004::/home/cliff.moore:/bin/bash
logger:x:1005:1005::/home/logger:/bin/sh
shared:x:1006:1006::/home/shared:/bin/sh
stacey.jenkins:x:1007:1007::/home/stacey.jenkins:/bin/bash
htb-student:x:1008:1008::/home/htb-student:/bin/bash
```

Information about groups can be found in the `/etc/group` file, which shows us both the group name and the assigned user names.

### Existing Groups
```shell-session
$ cat /etc/group

root:x:0:
daemon:x:1:
bin:x:2:
sys:x:3:
adm:x:4:syslog,htb-student
tty:x:5:syslog
disk:x:6:
lp:x:7:
mail:x:8:
news:x:9:
uucp:x:10:
man:x:12:
proxy:x:13:
kmem:x:15:
dialout:x:20:
fax:x:21:
voice:x:22:
cdrom:x:24:htb-student
floppy:x:25:
tape:x:26:
sudo:x:27:mrb3n,htb-student
audio:x:29:pulse
dip:x:30:htb-student
www-data:x:33:
...SNIP...
```

We can then use the [getent](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/getent.1.html) command to list members of any interesting groups:
```shell-session
$ getent group sudo

sudo:x:27:mrb3n
```

If we've gathered any passwords we should try them at this time for all users present on the system. Password re-use is common so we might get lucky!

A mounted file system is a file system that is attached to a particular directory. Many file systems, such as ext4, NTFS, and FAT32, can be mounted. Each type of file system has its own benefits and drawbacks. For example, some file systems can only be read by the operating system, while others can be read and written by the user. A user must have root privileges to mount or unmount a file system. We may have access to such file systems and may find sensitive information, documentation, or applications there:
```shell-session
$ df -h

Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev            1,9G     0  1,9G   0% /dev

/dev/loop9      347M  347M     0 100% /snap/gnome-3-38-2004/119
```

If we extend are privileges to root, we will be able to mount unmounted file systems, and read them.

### Unmounted File Systems
```shell-session
$ cat /etc/fstab | grep -v "#" | column -t

UUID=5bf16727-fcdf-4205-906c-0620aa4a058f  /          ext4  errors=remount-ro  0  1

/swapfile                                  none       swap  sw                 0  0
```

Hidden files and folders may contain sensitive information.

### All Hidden Files
```shell-session
$ find / -type f -name ".*" -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep htb-student

Both `/tmp` and `/var/tmp` are used to store data temporarily. The data retention time for `/var/tmp` is much longer then of the `/tmp` directory (30 days vs 10 days by default).

In addition, all temporary files stored in the `/tmp` directory are deleted immediately when the system is restarted. Therefore, the `/var/tmp` directory is used by programs to store data that must be kept between reboots temporarily.

## Moving On

Its worth running the [linPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) script at this point in a real-world assessment so we have as much data to dig through as possible. Oftentimes we can find an easy win but having this output handy can sometimes uncover nuanced issues that our manual enumeration missed.

Used this command to find the flag:
```shell-session
find / -type f -exec grep -l "HTB{" {} \; 2>/dev/null
```
