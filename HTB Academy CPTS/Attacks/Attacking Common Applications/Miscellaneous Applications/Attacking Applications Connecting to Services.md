Applications that are connected to services often include connection strings that can be leaked if they are not protected sufficiently. In the following paragraphs, we will go through the process of enumerating and exploiting applications that are connected to other services in order to extend their functionality. This can help us collect information and move laterally or escalate our privileges during penetration testing.

## ELF Executable Examination

The `octopus_checker` binary is found on a remote machine during the testing. Running the application locally reveals that it connects to database instances in order to verify that they are available:
```shell-session
$ ./octopus_checker 

Program had started..
Attempting Connection 
Connecting ... 

The driver reported the following diagnostics whilst running SQLDriverConnect

01000:1:0:[unixODBC][Driver Manager]Can't open lib 'ODBC Driver 17 for SQL Server' : file not found
connected
```

The binary probably connects using a SQL connection string that contains credentials. Using tools like [PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda) (Python Exploit Development Assistance for GDB) we can further examine the file. This is an extension of the standard GNU Debugger (GDB), which is used for debugging C and C++ programs. GDB is a command line tool that lets you step through the code, set breakpoints, and examine and change variables. Running the following command we can execute the binary through it:
```shell-session
$ gdb ./octopus_checker

```

Once the binary is loaded, we set the `disassembly-flavor` to define the display style of the code, and we proceed with disassembling the main function of the program:
```assembly
gdb-peda$ set disassembly-flavor intel
gdb-peda$ disas main

Dump of assembler code for function main:
   0x0000555555555456 <+0>:	endbr64 
   0x000055555555545a <+4>:	push   rbp
   0x000055555555545b <+5>:	mov    rbp,rsp
 
 <SNIP>

   0x0000555555555761 <+779>:	mov    rbx,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x8]
   0x0000555555555765 <+783>:	leave  
   0x0000555555555766 <+784>:	ret    
End of assembler dump.
```

This reveals several call instructions that point to addresses containing strings. They appear to be sections of a SQL connection string, but the sections are not in order, and the endianness entails that the string text is reversed. Endianness defines the order that the bytes are read in different architectures. Further down the function, we see a call to SQLDriverConnect:
```assembly
   0x00005555555555ff <+425>:	mov    esi,0x0
   0x0000555555555604 <+430>:	mov    rdi,rax
   0x0000555555555607 <+433>:	call   0x5555555551b0 <SQLDriverConnect@plt>
   0x000055555555560c <+438>:	add    rsp,0x10
   0x0000555555555610 <+442>:	mov    WORD PTR [rbp-0x4b4],ax
```

Adding a breakpoint at this address and running the program once again, reveals a SQL connection string in the RDX register address, containing the credentials for a local database instance:
```assembly
gdb-peda$ b *0x5555555551b0

Breakpoint 1 at 0x5555555551b0


gdb-peda$ run

```

Apart from trying to connect to the MS SQL service, penetration testers can also check if the password is reusable from users of the same network.

## DLL File Examination

A DLL file is a `Dynamically Linked Library` and it contains code that is called from other programs while they are running. The `MultimasterAPI.dll` binary is found on a remote machine during the enumeration process. Examination of the file reveals that this is a .Net assembly:
```powershell-session
C:\> Get-FileMetaData .\MultimasterAPI.dll

<SNIP>
M .NETFramework,Version=v4.6.1 TFrameworkDisplayName.NET Framework 4.6.1    api/getColleagues        ! htt

<SNIP>
```

Using the debugger and .NET assembly editor [dnSpy](https://github.com/0xd4d/dnSpy), we can view the source code directly. This tool allows reading, editing, and debugging the source code of a .NET assembly (C# and Visual Basic). Inspection of `MultimasterAPI.Controllers` -> `ColleagueController` reveals a database connection string containing the password:
![[dnspy_hidden.webp]]

Apart from trying to connect to the MS SQL service, attacks like password spraying can also be used to test the security of other services.
