There's an issue known as the "Double Hop" problem that arises when an attacker attempts to use Kerberos authentication across two (or more) hops. Tickets are signed pieces of data from the KDC that state what resources an account can access. When we perform Kerberos authentication, we get a "ticket" that permits us to access the requested resource (i.e., a single machine). On the contrary, when we use a password to authenticate, that NTLM hash is stored in our session and can be used elsewhere without issue.

## Background

The "Double Hop" problem often occurs when using WinRM/Powershell since the default authentication mechanism only provides a ticket to access a specific resource. It can cause issue when trying to perform lateral movement or even accessing file shells from the remote shell. In this case the user has the right to perform the access but is denied access. The most common way to get shells is by attacking an application on the target host or using credentials and a tool such as PSExec. In both of these scenarios, the initial authentication was likely performed over SMB or LDAP, which means the user's NTLM Hash would be stored in memory. Sometimes we have a set of credentials and are restricted to a particular method of authentication, such as WinRM, or would prefer to use WinRM for any number of reasons.

When using WinRM the user's password is never cached as part of their login. With Mimikatz we can see that all the credentials are blank.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> PS C:\Users\ben.INLANEFREIGHT> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DEV01 -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> cd 'C:\Users\Public\'
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\Public> .\mimikatz "privilege::debug" "sekurlsa::logonpasswords" exit
```

When we connect to a host with a tool such as Evil-WinRM, we connect with network authentication, so the credentials aren't stored in memory and, therefore, will not be present on the system to authenticate to other resources on behalf of our user. When we attempt for example query the DC, Kerberos has no way of telling him that our user can access resources in the domain. This happens because the Kerberos TGT ticket isn't sent to the remote session, and commands will no longer be run in this user's context. when authenticating to the target host, the user's ticket-granting service (TGS) ticket is sent to the remote service, and this is why we can still run commands.

If unconstrained delegation is enabled on a server, it is likely we will not face the double hop problem. In this scenario the TGT is sent along with the TGS with the request. In other words, the account's TGS Ticket is cached, which has the ability to sign TGTs and grant remote access. Generally speaking, if you land on a box with unconstrained delegation, you already won and aren't worrying about this anyways.

## Workarounds

A few workarounds for the double-hop issue are covered in [this post](https://posts.slayerlabs.com/double-hop/). We can use a "nested" `Invoke-Command` to send credentials (after creating a PSCredential object) with every request. The first method will work for `evil-winrm` session, and the second if we have GUI access to a Windows host.

### Workaround #1: PSCredential Object

We can also connect to the remote host via host A and set up a PSCredential object to pass our credentials again.

We can see that using tools such as PowerView will not be successful.

```shell-session
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> import-module .\PowerView.ps1

|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn
Exception calling "FindAll" with "0" argument(s): "An operations error occurred.
"
At C:\Users\backupadm\Documents\PowerView.ps1:5253 char:20
+             else { $Results = $UserSearcher.FindAll() }
+                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DirectoryServicesCOMException
```

If we check with `klist`, we see that we only have a cached Kerberos ticket for our current server.

```shell-session
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> klist

Current LogonId is 0:0x57f8a

Cached Tickets: (1)

#0> Client: backupadm @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
    Server: academy-aen-ms0$ @
    KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
    Ticket Flags 0xa10000 -> renewable pre_authent name_canonicalize
    Start Time: 6/28/2022 7:31:53 (local)
    End Time:   6/28/2022 7:46:53 (local)
    Renew Time: 7/5/2022 7:31:18 (local)
    Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
    Cache Flags: 0x4 -> S4U
    Kdc Called: DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

So now, let's set up a PSCredential object and try again. First, we set up our authentication.

```shell-session
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> $SecPassword = ConvertTo-SecureString '!qazXSW@' -AsPlainText -Force
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents>  $Cred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential('INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm', $SecPassword)
```

Now we can try PowerView again with the credentials
```shell-session
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn -credential $Cred | select samaccountname

|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK
|S-chain|-<>-127.0.0.1:9051-<><>-172.16.8.50:5985-<><>-OK

samaccountname

azureconnect
backupjob
krbtgt
mssqlsvc

sapvc
vmwarescvc
```

### Workaround #2: Register PSSession Configuration

When entering WinRM session from a Windows host, we have another option to change our setup to be able to interact directly with the DC or other hosts/resources without having to set up a PSCredential object and include credentials along with every command (which may not be an option with some tools).

Let's start by first establishing a WinRM session on the remote host.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL -Credential inlanefreight\backupadm
```

If we check for cached tickets using `klist`, we'll see that the same problem exists. We can see that our current TGS is good for accessing the HTTP service on the target since we connected over WinRM, which uses SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) requests in XML format to communicate over HTTP, so it makes sense.

```powershell-session
[ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> klist

Current LogonId is 0:0x11e387

Cached Tickets: (1)

#0>     Client: backupadm @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
       Server: HTTP/ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
       KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Ticket Flags 0x40a10000 -> forwardable renewable pre_authent name_canonicalize
       Start Time: 6/28/2022 9:09:19 (local)
       End Time:   6/28/2022 19:09:19 (local)
       Renew Time: 0
       Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Cache Flags: 0x8 -> ASC
       Kdc Called:
```

We also cannot interact directly with the DC using PowerView

```powershell-session
[ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> Import-Module .\PowerView.ps1
[ACADEMY-AEN-DEV01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> get-domainuser -spn | select samaccountname

Exception calling "FindAll" with "0" argument(s): "An operations error occurred.
"
At C:\Users\backupadm\Documents\PowerView.ps1:5253 char:20
+             else { $Results = $UserSearcher.FindAll() }
+                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (:) [], MethodInvocationException
   + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DirectoryServicesCOMException
```

One trick we can use here is registering a new session configuration using the [Register-PSSessionConfiguration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/register-pssessionconfiguration?view=powershell-7.2) cmdlet.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Register-PSSessionConfiguration -Name backupadmsess -RunAsCredential inlanefreight\backupadm
```

Once this is done, we need to restart the WinRM service by typing `Restart-Service WinRM` in our current PSSession. This will kick us out, so we'll start a new PSSession using the named registered session we set up previously.

After we start the session, we can see that the double hop problem has been eliminated, and if we type `klist`, we'll have the cached tickets necessary to reach the Domain Controller. This works because our local machine will now impersonate the remote machine in the context of the `backupadm` user and all requests from our local machine will be sent directly to the Domain Controller.

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Enter-PSSession -ComputerName DEV01 -Credential INLANEFREIGHT\backupadm -ConfigurationName  backupadmsess
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\backupadm\Documents> klist

Current LogonId is 0:0x2239ba

Cached Tickets: (1)

#0>     Client: backupadm @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
       Server: krbtgt/INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL @ INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
       KerbTicket Encryption Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Ticket Flags 0x40e10000 -> forwardable renewable initial pre_authent name_canonicalize
       Start Time: 6/28/2022 13:24:37 (local)
       End Time:   6/28/2022 23:24:37 (local)
       Renew Time: 7/5/2022 13:24:37 (local)
       Session Key Type: AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
       Cache Flags: 0x1 -> PRIMARY
       Kdc Called: DC01
```

We can now run tools such as PowerView without having to create a new PSCredential object.

```powershell-session
[DEV01]: PS C:\Users\Public> get-domainuser -spn | select samaccountname

samaccountname
--------------
azureconnect
backupjob
krbtgt
mssqlsvc
sqltest
sqlqa
sqldev
mssqladm
svc_sql
sqlprod
sapsso
sapvc
vmwarescvc
```

Note: We cannot use `Register-PSSessionConfiguration` from an evil-winrm shell because we won't be able to get the credentials popup. Furthermore, if we try to run this by first setting up a PSCredential object and then attempting to run the command by passing credentials like `-RunAsCredential $Cred`, we will get an error because we can only use `RunAs` from an elevated PowerShell terminal. Therefore, this method will not work via an evil-winrm session as it requires GUI access and a proper PowerShell console.

We can also use other methods such as CredSSP, port forwarding, or injecting into a process running in the context of a target user (sacrificial process).
