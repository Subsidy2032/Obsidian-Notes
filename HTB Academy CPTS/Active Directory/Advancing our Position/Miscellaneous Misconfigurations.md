## Exchange Related Group Membership

A default installation of Microsoft Exchange within an AD environment (with no split-administration model) opens up many attack vectors, as Exchange is often granted considerable privileges within the domain (via users, groups, and ACLs). The group `Exchange Windows Permissions` is not listed as a protected group, but members are granted the ability to write a DACL to the domain object. This can be leveraged to give a user DCSync privileges. An attacker can add accounts to this group by leveraging a DACL misconfiguration (possible) or by leveraging a compromised account that is a member of the Account Operators group. It is common to find user accounts and even computers as members of this group. Power users and support staff in remote offices are often added to this group, allowing them to reset password. This [GitHub repo](https://github.com/gdedrouas/Exchange-AD-Privesc) details a few techniques for leveraging Exchange for escalating privileges in an AD environment.

The Exchange group `Organization Management` is another extremely powerful group (effectively the "Domain Admins" of Exchange) and can access the mailboxes of all domain users. It is not uncommon for sysadmins to be members of this group. This group also has full control of the OU called `Microsoft Exchange Security Groups`, which contains the group `Exchange Windows Permissions`.

### Viewing Organization Management Permissions
![[org_mgmt_perms.webp]]

Compromising an Exchange server will often lead to Domain Admin privileges. Additionally dumping credentials in memory from an Exchange server will produce 10s if not 100s of cleartext credentials or NTLM hashes. This is often due to users logging in to Outlook Web Access (OWA) and Exchange caching their credentials in memory after a successful login.

## PrivExchange

The `PrivExchange` attack results from a flaw in the Exchange server `PushSubscription` feature, which allows any domain user with a mailbox to force the Exchange server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over HTTP.

The Exchange service runs as SYSTEM and is over-privileged by default (i.e., has WriteDacl privileges on the domain pre-2019 Cumulative Update). This flaw can be leveraged to relay to LDAP and dump the domain NTDS database. If we cannot relay to LDAP, this can be leveraged to relay and authenticate to other hosts within the domain. This attack will take you directly to Domain Admin with any authenticated domain user account.

## Printer Bug

The Printer Bug is a flaw in the MS-RPRN protocol (Print System Remote Protocol). This protocol defines the communication of print job processing and print system management between a client and a print server. To leverage this flaw, any domain user can connect to the spool's named pipe with the `RpcOpenPrinter` method and use the `RpcRemoteFindFirstPrinterChangeNotificationEx` method, and force the server to authenticate to any host provided by the client over SMB.

The spooler service runs as SYSTEM and is installed by default in windows servers running Desktop Experience. This attack can be leveraged to relay to LDAP and grant your attacker account DCSync privileges to retrieve all password hashes from AD.

The attack can also be used to relay LDAP authentication and grant Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD) privileges for the victim to a computer account under our control, thus giving the attacker privileges to authenticate as any user on the victim's computer. This attack can be leveraged to compromise a DC in a partner domain/forest, provided you have administrative access to a Domain Controller in the first forest/domain already, and the trust allows TGT delegation, which is not by default anymore.

We can use tools such as the `Get-SpoolStatus` module from [this](http://web.archive.org/web/20200919080216/https://github.com/cube0x0/Security-Assessment) tool or [this](https://github.com/NotMedic/NetNTLMtoSilverTicket) tool to check for machines vulnerable to the [MS-PRN Printer Bug](https://blog.sygnia.co/demystifying-the-print-nightmare-vulnerability). This flaw can be used to compromise a host in another forest that has Unconstrained Delegation enabled, such as a domain controller.

### Enumerating for MS-PRN Printer Bug
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Import-Module .\SecurityAssessment.ps1
PS C:\htb> Get-SpoolStatus -ComputerName ACADEMY-EA-DC01.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL
```

### MS14-068

This was a flaw in the Kerberos protocol, which allowed escalating privileges from a standard domain user to Domain Admin. A Kerberos ticket contains information about a user, including the account name, ID, and group membership in the Privilege Attribute Certificate (PAC). The PAC is signed by the KDC using secret keys to validate that the PAC has not been tampered with after creation.

The vulnerability allowed a forged PAC to be accepted by the KDC as legitimate. This can be used to present a user as a member of the Domain Administrators or other privileged group. t can be exploited with tools such as the [Python Kerberos Exploitation Kit (PyKEK)](https://github.com/SecWiki/windows-kernel-exploits/tree/master/MS14-068/pykek) or the Impacket toolkit. The only defense against this attack is patching. The machine [Mantis](https://app.hackthebox.com/machines/98) on the Hack The Box platform showcases this vulnerability.

## Sniffing LDAP Credentials

Many applications and printers store LDAP credentials in their web admin console to connect to the domain. These consoles are often left with weak or default passwords. Sometimes, those credentials can be viewed in clear text. Other times the application has a `test connection` function that we can use to gather credentials by changing the LDAP IP address to that of our attack host and setting up a `netcat` listener on LDAP port 389. When the device attempts to test the LDAP connection, it will send the credentials to our machine, often in cleartext. Accounts used for LDAP connections are often privileged, but if not, this could serve as initial foothold in the domain. Other times, a full LDAP server is required to pull of this attack, as detailed in this [post](https://grimhacker.com/2018/03/09/just-a-printer/).

## Enumerating DNS Records

We can use a tool such as [adidnsdump](https://github.com/dirkjanm/adidnsdump) to enumerate all DNS records in a domain using a valid domain user account. This is especially useful if the naming convention for hosts returned to us in our enumeration using tools such as BloodHound is similar to `SRV01934.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`. If all servers and workstations have non-descriptive name, it makes it difficult for us to know what exactly to attack. If we can access DNS entries in AD, we can potentially discover interesting DNS records that point to this same server, such as `JENKINS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`, which we can use to better plan our attacks.

The tool works because, by default, all users can list the child objects of a DNS zone in an AD environment. By default, querying DNS records using LDAP does not return all results. So by using the `adidnsdump` tool, we can resolve all records in the zone and potentially find something useful for our engagement. The background and more in-depth explanation of this tool and technique can be found in this [post](https://dirkjanm.io/getting-in-the-zone-dumping-active-directory-dns-with-adidnsdump/).

On the first run of the tool, we can see that some records are blank, for example `?,LOGISTICS,?`.

### Using adidnsdump
```shell-session
$ adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 

Password: 

[-] Connecting to host...
[-] Binding to host
[+] Bind OK
[-] Querying zone for records
[+] Found 27 records
```

The results will be saved to the `records.csv` file.

If we run again with the `-r` flag the tool will attempt to resolve unknown records by performing an `A` query. Now we can see IP address for previously blank records.

### Using the -r Option to Resolve Unknown Records
```shell-session
$ adidnsdump -u inlanefreight\\forend ldap://172.16.5.5 -r
```

## Other Misconfigurations

### Password in Description Field

sensitive information such as account passwords are sometimes found in the user account `Description` or `Notes` fields and can be quickly enumerated using PowerView. For large domains, it is helpful to export this data to a CSV file to review offline.

#### Finding Passwords in the Description Field Using Get-Domain User
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser * | Select-Object samaccountname,description |Where-Object {$_.Description -ne $null}

samaccountname description
-------------- -----------
administrator  Built-in account for administering the computer/domain
guest          Built-in account for guest access to the computer/domain
krbtgt         Key Distribution Center Service Account
ldap.agent     *** DO NOT CHANGE ***  3/12/2012: Sunsh1ne4All!
```

### PASSWD_NOTREQD Field

It is possible to come across domain accounts with the [passwd_notreqd](https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=PASSWD_NOTREQD) field set in the userAccountControl attribute. If this is set, the user is not subject to the current password policy length, meaning they can have a shorter password or no password at all (if empty passwords are allowed in the domain). password may be set as blank intentionally (sometimes admins donâ€™t want to be called out of hours to reset user passwords) or accidentally hitting enter before entering a password when changing it via the command line. One reason for this flag being set is that a vendor product set this flag on certain accounts at the time of installation and never removed the flag. It is worth enumerating accounts with this flag set and testing each to see if no password is required. Also, include it in the client report if the goal of the assessment is to be as comprehensive as possible.

#### Checking for PASSWD_NOTREQD Setting using Get-DomainUser
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -UACFilter PASSWD_NOTREQD | Select-Object samaccountname,useraccountcontrol
```

### Credentials in SMB Shares and SYSVOL Scripts

The SYSVOL share can be a treasure trove of data, especially in large organizations. We may find many different batch, VBScript, and PowerShell scripts within the scripts directory, which is readable by all authenticated users in the domain, which can also store passwords. Sometimes we will find very old scripts containing since disabled accounts or old passwords, but from time to time, we will strike gold, so we should always dig through this directory.

#### Discovering an Interesting Script
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> ls \\academy-ea-dc01\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts
```

we see that the script contains a password. In this case, it would be worth checking to see if this password is still set on any hosts in the domain. We could do this using CrackMapExec and the `--local-auth` flag as shown in this module's `Internal Password Spraying - from Linux` section.

### Group Policy Preferences (GPP) Passwords

When a new GPP is created, an .xml file is created in the SYSVOL share, which is also cached locally on endpoints that the Group Policy applies to. These files can include those used to:

- Map drives (drives.xml)
- Create local users
- Create printer config files (printers.xml)
- Creating and updating services (services.xml)
- Creating scheduled tasks (scheduledtasks.xml)
- Changing local admin passwords.

These files can contain an array of configuration data and defined passwords. The `cpassword` attribute value is AES-256 bit encrypted, but Microsoft [published the AES private key on MSDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-gppref/2c15cbf0-f086-4c74-8b70-1f2fa45dd4be?redirectedfrom=MSDN), which can be used to decrypt the password. Any domain user can read those files as they are stored in the SYSVOL share, and all authenticated users in the domain, by default, have access to the domain controller share.

This was patched in 2014 [MS14-025 Vulnerability in GPP could allow elevation of privilege](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/ms14-025-vulnerability-in-group-policy-preferences-could-allow-elevation-of-privilege-may-13-2014-60734e15-af79-26ca-ea53-8cd617073c30), to prevent administrators from setting passwords using GPP. The patch does not remove existing Groups.xml files with password from SYSVOL. If you delete the GPP instead of unlinking it from the OU, the cached copy on the local computer remains.

The XML looks like the following:

![[GPP.png]]

If you retrieve the cpassword value more manually, the `gpp-decrypt` utility can be used to decrypt the password as follows:

#### Decrypting the Password with gpp-decrypt
```shell-session
$ gpp-decrypt VPe/o9YRyz2cksnYRbNeQj35w9KxQ5ttbvtRaAVqxaE
```

GPP passwords can be located by searching or manually browsing the SYSVOL share or using tools such as [Get-GPPPassword.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Get-GPPPassword.ps1), the GPP Metasploit Post Module, and other Python/Ruby scripts which will locate the GPP and return the decrypted cpassword value. CrackMapExec also has two modules for locating and retrieving GPP passwords. One quick tip to consider during engagements: Often, GPP passwords are defined for legacy accounts, and you may therefore retrieve and decrypt the password for a locked or deleted account. However, it is worth attempting to password spray internally with this password (especially if it is unique). Password re-use is widespread, and the GPP password combined with password spraying could result in further access.

#### Locating & Retrieving GPP Passwords with CrackMapExec
```shell-session
$ crackmapexec smb -L | grep gpp
```

It is also possible to find passwords in files such as Registry.xml when autologon is configured via Group Policy. This may be set up for any number of reasons for a machine to automatically log in at boot. If this is set via Group Policy and not locally on the host, then anyone in the domain can retrieve credentials stored in the file created for this purpose. Microsoft has not taken any action to block storing those credentials on the SYSVOL in cleartext, hence, are readable by any authenticated user in the domain. We can hunt for this using CrackMapExec with the [gpp_autologin](https://www.infosecmatter.com/crackmapexec-module-library/?cmem=smb-gpp_autologin) module, or using the [Get-GPPAutologon.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Get-GPPAutologon.ps1) script included in PowerSploit.

#### Using CrackMapExec's gpp_autologin Module
```shell-session
$ crackmapexec smb 172.16.5.5 -u forend -p Klmcargo2 -M gpp_autologin
```

This may be set up so different shifts can use the same workstations. In this case the credentials are likely local admin, so it would be worth finding hosts where we can log in as an admin and hunt for additional data. Sometimes we may discover credentials for a highly privileged user or credentials for a disabled account/an expired password that is no use to us.

We should always check for access to other hosts using obtained credentials (as a domain or local user), leverage any rights such as interesting ACLs, and access shares.

### ASREPRoasting

It is possible to obtain the TGT for any account that don't have the [Do not require Kerberos pre-authentication](https://www.tenable.com/blog/how-to-stop-the-kerberos-pre-authentication-attack-in-active-directory) setting enabled. Many vendor installation guides specify that their service account be configured this way. The authentication service replay (AS_REP) is encrypted with the account's password, and any domain user can request it.

With pre-authentication a user enters their password, which encrypts a time stamp. The DC will decrypt this to validate that the correct password was used. If successful a TGT will be issued to the user for further authentication requests in the domain. If an account has pre-authentication disabled, an attacker can request authentication data for the affected account and retrieve an encrypted TGT from the DC.

#### Viewing an Account with the Do not Require Kerberos Preauthentication option
![[preauth_not_reqd_mmorgan.png]]

ASREPRoasting is similar to Kerberoasting, but it involves attacking the AS-REP instead of the TGS-REP. An SPN is not required. This setting can be enumerated with PowerView or built-in tools such as the PowerShell AD module.

The attack itself can be performed with the [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus) toolkit and other tools to obtain the ticket for the target account. If an attacker has `GenericWrite` or `GenericAll` permissions over an account, they can enable this attribute and obtain the AS-REP ticket for offline cracking then disabling the attribute again. Like Kerberoasting, the success of this attack depends on the account having a relatively weak password.

Below is an example of the attack. PowerView can be used to enumerate users with their UAC value set to `DONT_REQ_PREAUTH`.

#### Enumerating for DONT_REQ_PREAUTH Value using Get-DomainUser
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainUser -PreauthNotRequired | select samaccountname,userprincipalname,useraccountcontrol | fl
```

With this information in hand the Rubeus tool can be leveraged to retrieve the AS-REP in the proper format for offline hash cracking. This attack does not require any domain user context and can be done by just knowing the SAM name for the user without Kerberos pre-auth. Remember, add the `/nowrap` flag so the ticket is not column wrapped and is retrieved in a format that we can readily feed into Hashcat.

#### Retrieving AS-REP in Proper Format using Rubeus
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> .\Rubeus.exe asreproast /user:mmorgan /nowrap /format:hashcat
```

We can then crack the hash offline using Hashcat with mode `18200`.

#### Cracking the Hash Offline with Hashcat
```shell-session
$ hashcat -m 18200 ilfreight_asrep /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt 
```

When performing user enumeration with `Kerbrute`, the tool will automatically retrieve the AS-REP for any users found that do not require Kerberos pre-authentication.

#### Retrieving the AS-REP Using Kerbrute
```shell-session
$ kerbrute userenum -d inlanefreight.local --dc 172.16.5.5 /opt/jsmith.txt 
```

With a list of valid user we can use [Get-NPUsers.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py) from the Impacket toolkit to hunt for all users with Kerberos pre-authentication not required. The tool will retrieve the AS-REP in Hashcat format for offline cracking. We can also feed a wordlist such as `jsmith.txt` into the tool, it will throw errors for users that do not exist. Even if we are unable to crack the AS-REP using Hashcat it is still good to report this as a finding to clients (just lower risk if we cannot crack the password) so they can assess whether or not the account requires this setting.

#### Hunting for Users with Kerberoast Pre-Auth Not Required
```shell-session
$ GetNPUsers.py INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL/ -dc-ip 172.16.5.5 -no-pass -usersfile valid_ad_users 
```

### Group Policy Object (GPO) Abuse

Group Policy provides administrators with many advanced settings that can be applied to both user an computer object in an AD environment. Group Policy, when used right, is an excellent tool for hardening an AD environment by configuring user settings, operating systems, and applications. But Group Policy can also be abused by attackers. If we can gain rights over a GPO via an ACL misconfiguration, we could leverage this for lateral movement, privilege escalation, and even domain compromise and as a persistence mechanism within the domain. Understanding how to enumerate and attack GPOs can give us a leg up and can sometimes be the ticket to achieving our goal in a rather locked-down environment.

GPO misconfigurations can be abused to perform the following attacks:

- Adding additional rights to a user (such as SeDebugPrivilege, SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege, or SeImpersonatePrivilege)
- Adding a local admin user to one or more hosts
- Creating an immediate scheduled task to perform any number of actions

We can enumerate GPO information using many of the tools we've been using throughout this module such as PowerView and BloodHound. We can also use [group3r](https://github.com/Group3r/Group3r), [ADRecon](https://github.com/sense-of-security/ADRecon), [PingCastle](https://www.pingcastle.com/), among others, to audit the security of GPOs in a domain.

#### Enumerating GPO Names with PowerView
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO |select displayname
```

This can be helpful for us to begin to see what types of security measures are in place (such as denying cmd.exe access and a separate password policy for service accounts). If autologon is in use which may mean there is a readable password in a GPO. Also we can see if Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) is present in the domain. If Group Policy Management tools are installed on the host we are working from, we can use various built-in [GroupPolicy cmdlets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/grouppolicy/?view=windowsserver2022-ps) such as `Get-GPO` to perform the same enumeration.

#### Enumerating GPO Names with a Built-In Cmdlet
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> Get-GPO -All | Select DisplayName
```

Next, we can check if a user we can control has any rights over a GPO. Specific users or groups may be granted rights to administer one or more GPOs. A good first check is to see if the entire Domain Users group has any rights over one or more GPOs.

#### Enumerating Domain User GPO Rights
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> $sid=Convert-NameToSid "Domain Users"
PS C:\htb> Get-DomainGPO | Get-ObjectAcl | ?{$_.SecurityIdentifier -eq $sid}
```

`WriteProperty` and `WriteDacl` can give full control over the GPO and pull off any number of attacks that would be pushed down to any users and computers in OUs that the GPO is applied to.

We can use the GPO GUID combined with `Get-GPO` to see the display name of the GPO.

#### Converting GPO GUID to Name
```powershell-session
PS C:\htb Get-GPO -Guid 7CA9C789-14CE-46E3-A722-83F4097AF532
```

Checking in BloodHound, we can see that the `Domain Users` group has several rights over the `Disconnect Idle RDP` GPO, which could be leveraged for full control of the object.

![[gporights.webp]]

If we select the GPO in BloodHound and scroll down to `Affected Objects` on the `Node Info` tab, we can see that this GPO is applied to one OU, which contains four computer objects.

![image](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/143/gpoaffected.png)

We could use a tool such as [SharpGPOAbuse](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse) to take advantage of this GPO misconfiguration by performing actions such as adding a user that we control to the local admins group on one of the affected hosts, creating an immediate scheduled task on one of the hosts to give us a reverse shell, or configure a malicious computer startup script to provide us with a reverse shell or similar. When using a tool like this, we need to be careful because commands can be run that affect every computer within the OU that the GPO is linked to. If we found an editable GPO that applies to an OU with 1,000 computers, we would not want to make the mistake of adding ourselves as a local admin to that many hosts. Some of the attack options available with this tool allow us to specify a target user or host.
