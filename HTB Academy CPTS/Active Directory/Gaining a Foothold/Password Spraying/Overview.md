Password spraying attack involves using one common password and a long list of usernames or email addresses. The usernames and email addresses can be gathered during the OSINT phase or the initial enumeration attempts.

Carless use of this attack can cause considerable harm, such as locking out hundreds of production accounts.

This attack is less likely to lock out users then a brute force attack, but it still presents a risk, so the delay is essential. Internal password spraying can be used to move laterally within a network, with internal access we might be able to obtain the domain password policy, which significantly reduces the risk.

Itâ€™s common to find a password policy that allows five bad attempts before locking out the account, with a 30-minute auto-unlock threshold. Some organizations expand upon this, even requiring an administrator to unlock the accounts manually. Without the password policy, a good rule of thumb is to wait a few hours between attempts. We can choose to do just one targeted password spraying attempt as a hail mary if all other options for a foothold or furthering access have been exhausted. Depending on the type of assessment, we can always ask the client to verify the password policy.
